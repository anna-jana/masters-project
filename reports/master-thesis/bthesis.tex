\begin{abstract}
  In this thesis we determine the baryon asymmetry of the universe numerically in a model of spontaneous baryogenesis. We consider
  two different models, a generic model of an axion-like-particle and a model of a clockwork axion. The clockwork model also generates a dark matter density.
  Both models have been discussed in the literature but the results have not been computed correctly as was previously pointed out.
  We do this using a formalism developed in the literature based on a transport equation derived in linear response theory, which we discuss in detail. We apply this formalism to concrete models for the first time.
  Furthermore we elaborate on multiple coupled fields, without coming up with an interesting one.

\chapter{Introduction}

In this thesis we will investigate a potential solution to the problem of \emph{baryogenesis}, that is
the question why we find that our universe as we observe it today, is made up of matter and not antimatter.
This asymmetry is necessary for more complicated structures in universe to exits. From atoms to life to finally humans who wonder about the universe \footnote{and discriminated based on gender, race, religion ..., let each other live in poverty and destroy the planet. But that doesn't sound so cool, right?}
On a fundamental level the two are almost mirror images of each other. The standard model does only very weakly distinguish between the two.
Hence physics beyond the standard model is needed to explain the asymmetry.
The mechanism we consider in this thesis is called \emph{spontaneous baryogenesis}, first proposed by Andreq Cohen and David Kapla in 1987 \cite{COHEN1987251} \cite{COHEN1988913}.
The basis idea behind this mechanism is that a classical cosmological field evolves and hence was a non-vanishing time-derivative.
This time-derivative then biases some reactions in such a way that an asymmetry is produced.
We will investiage the quantitative outcome of this process for different axion models for the cosmological field.
Axions are group of proposed particles which extend the standard model.
They were first proposed to solve the strong-CP problem in QCD \cite{PQ1} \cite{PQ2} \cite{Weinberg:1977ma} \cite{Wilczek:1977pj}. Today axions are a wide class of particle models which are based on some kind of shift-symmetric pseudo-scalar whos shift-symmetry is often broken by non-perturbatativ effects like instantons.
For the model of the axion field we are based on the work for a simple generic ALP model in ref. \cite{Kusenko_2015_Axion_Leptogenesis}, a clockwork axion from ref. \cite{Deformed_potential_Bae_2019} and \cite{general_cont_clockwork_Choi_2018} as well as multi axion potential which have not yet been investigated for baryogenesis model but in the context of inflation \cite{Kim_multi_axions:2004rp}.
Sometimes the term axions only refer to QCD axions or even only to the original WWPQ axion model. The general class of particles are called axion-like-particles (ALPs). We however refer to thesis kinds of standard model extension always as axions.
Also we consider different couplings of these axion fields to standard model particles. For this, this thesis is based on the work of the authors of ref. \cite{Domcke:2020kcp_Generic_Couplings}, who developed a formalism using a transport equation in linear response theory to compute the asymmetry for a number of couplings.
Let us now go over the structure of this thesis.
In chapter \ref{sec:fundermentals} we go over the basis of cosmology including reheating and baryogenesis.
Then in chapter \ref{sec:spontaneous_baryogenesis} we talk about how spontanous baryogenesis works in general.
The next two chapter are technical derivations required for our later computations. First the transport equation for charges in chapter \ref{sec:transport_equation} and then the axion field models in chapter \ref{sec:motion_of_the_axion_field} are derived.
After this we briefly comment on the implementation of the numerical model in chapter \ref{sec:implementation_of_the_numerical_simulations}.
Finally we present our results for each model in chapter \ref{sec:results}
and finish by summarizing the thesis and our results and looking at further possible directions of research.

\chapter{Fundamentals}
\label{sec:fundermentals}

\section{Early Universe Cosmology}
In this section we will introduce the basics of cosmology and the background cosmological model we will use for the computations in this thesis later on.
A good reference and the source for this section is \cite{the_early_universe_kolb_and_turner}.

\subsection{Dynamics of the Expansion of the Universe}
\label{sec:dynamics_of_the_examsion_of_the_universe}
The dynamics of the expanding universe is governed by Einsteins theory of general relativity. The Einstein field-equation connects geometry i.e. the curvature with the content i.e. the energy-momentum tensor $T$ of the universe \footnote{
See \cite{carroll_spacetime_and_geometry_2019} for definitions of these quantities.
}:
\begin{equation}
	R_{\mu \nu} - \frac{1}{2} R g_{\mu \nu} = 8 \pi G T_{\mu \nu}.
\end{equation}
We assume the cosmological assumption i.e. that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on the large scales we are interested in. In this case the most general form of the metric is the Friedmann-Lametre-Robinson-Walker metric, which reads:
\begin{equation}
	\mathrm{d} s^2 = - \mathrm{d} t^2 + a(t) \left[ \frac{\mathrm{d} r^2}{1 - kr^2} + \mathrm{d} \Omega \right].
\end{equation}
The quatitiy $a$ is called the scale factor and has to be determined by the Einstein field-equations.
The parameter $k$ fixes the topology of the universe. In this thesis we use $k = 0$ i.e. a flat universe as suggested by data of e.g. the Planck mission data \cite{planck2018}.
On the otherhand the content of an homogeneous and isotropic universe filled with a perfect fluid, has a diagonal energy-momentum tensor given by:
\begin{equation}
	T_\nu^\mu = \operatorname{diag}(\rho, P, P, P),
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ is the energy-density and $P$ the pressure.
Plugging these assumption into the Einstein field-equations yields the Friedmann equation (a first order constraint, from the $T^{00}$ component) \footnote{
A useful compact form of the Friedmann equation for $k = 0$ and $M_\mathrm{pl} = 1 / \sqrt{8 \pi G}$ is $3 M_\mathrm{pl} H^2 = \rho$
}:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:friedmann_equation}
	\boxed{
	\left( \frac{\dot{a}}{a} \right)^2 = \frac{8 \pi G}{3} \rho - \frac{k}{a^2}
	}
\end{equation}
as well as the acceleration equation (second order e.o.m., from the trace of $T$) \footnote{
See \cite[sec. 2.1, 3.1]{the_early_universe_kolb_and_turner} for intermediate steps of the derivation from the Einstein field equations.
}
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\ddot{a}}{a} = - \frac{4 \pi G}{3} ( \rho + 3 p ).
\end{equation}
From these equations one can derive a continuity equation for the energy-momentum tensor
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:continuity_equation}
	\dot{\rho} = - 3 H (\rho + P),
\end{equation}
where $H = \frac{\dot{a}}{a}$ is the Hubble-parameter. \\
\noindent A set of useful solutions for $k = $ can be derived for a power-law dependence of the energy density on the scale-factor $\rho = \rho_0 a^X$ i.e. that the dilution of the energy is described by a power-law. For this we also introduce the so called equation of state (e.o.s.)
\begin{equation}
	w = \frac{P}{\rho}.
\end{equation}
It can in general have a complicated form and depend on further parameters such as temperature or field configurations, but we will assume a constant e.o.s. $w$ for now.
Then one finds using eq. \eqref{eq:continuity_equation}:
\begin{equation}
	\rho \sim a^{-3(1 + w)}.
\end{equation}
This result is important as most of the universes history falls into this case.
One finds the following relations:
\begin{align}
	p &= \frac{1}{3} \rho \implies \rho \sim a^{-4} \quad \mathrm{(Radiation)} \nonumber \\
	p &= 0 \implies \rho \sim a^{-3} \quad \mathrm{(Matter)} \nonumber \\
	p &= - \rho \implies \rho \sim \mathrm{const} \quad \mathrm{(Vacuum Energy)}
\end{align}
While matter is just diluted in numbers by the expansion, radiation is also redshifted.
Vacuum energy is essentially defined by this equation of state.
Finally we mention that energy densities is often stated relative to the critical-density $\rho_c = \frac{3 H^2}{8 \pi G}$ as
\begin{equation}
	\Omega_i = \frac{\rho_i}{\rho_c}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Cosmological Equilibrium Thermodynamics}
We will now cover the thermodynamic description of the particle content of the universe
in equilibrium.
In this case the distribution of particles is given by Fermi-Dirac or Bose-Einstein for ferminons or bosons respectively \footnote{

}:
\begin{equation}
	f(\mathbf{p}) = \frac{1}{\exp((E - \mu) / T) \pm 1},
\end{equation}
where we have the relativistic relation for the energy $E^2 = p^2 + m^2$. The distribution is parametrized by the temperature $T$ and the chemical potential $\mu$.
Note the different sign in the expression for fermions and bosons.
From this probability distribution one can compute the important thermodynamics observables.
The number density of particles:
\begin{equation}
	n = \frac{g}{(2\pi)^3} \int \mathrm{d}^3 p f(\mathbf{p})
\end{equation}
The energy density:
\begin{equation}
	\rho = \frac{g}{(2\pi)^3} \int \mathrm{d}^3 p E(\mathbf{p}) f(\mathbf{p})
\end{equation}
The pressure:
\begin{equation}
	p = \frac{g}{(2\pi)^3} \int \mathrm{d}^3 p \frac{p^2}{3E(\mathbf{p})} f(\mathbf{p})
\end{equation}
These integrals can be evaluated in the relativistic limit where $m \ll T$:
\begin{equation}
	\rho = \begin{cases}
		\frac{\pi^2}{30} g T^4 & \text{Bosons} \\
		\frac{7}{8} \frac{\pi^2}{30} g T^4 & \text{Fermions}
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	n = \begin{cases}
		\frac{\zeta(3)}{\pi^2} g T^3 & \text{Bosons} \\
		\frac{3}{4} \frac{\zeta(3)}{\pi^2} g T^3 & \text{Fermions}
	\end{cases}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	p = \rho / 3
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	s = \frac{2 \pi^2}{45} g_i T^3
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	n_+ - n_- \approx \frac{g T^3}{6} \left( \frac{\mu}{T} \right)
\end{equation}

This result can be generalized to multiple particle species by using effective degrees of freedom $g_*$:
\begin{align}
	\rho &= \frac{\pi^2}{30} g_{*, \rho}(T) T^4 \nonumber \\
	s &= \frac{2 \pi^2}{45} g_i T^3
\end{align}
with
\begin{equation}
	g_{*, \rho} = \sum_{i, \text{bosons}} g_i \left( \frac{T_i}{T} \right)^4 + \frac{7}{8} \sum_{i, \text{fermions}} g_i \left( \frac{T_i}{T} \right)^4
\end{equation}
and for the entropy:
\begin{equation}
	g_{*, s} = \sum_{i, \text{bosons}} g_i \left( \frac{T_i}{T} \right)^3 + \frac{7}{8} \sum_{i, \text{fermions}} g_i \left( \frac{T_i}{T} \right)^3.
\end{equation}
These expressions allow us to model the standard model plasma in the early universe, if
all interactions are fast enough.


\subsection{Inflation and Reheating}
In order to solve several problems with standard Friedmann cosmology as discussed so far e.g. the flatness problem i.e. the fine-tuning of $k = 0$,
an epoch of exponential expansion before the usual subsequent evolution of the universe is proposed. The easiest way to implement this, is so called slow-roll inflation. In this model a scalar field called the inflaton field $\phi$ with a mass $m_\mathrm{inf}$ is introduced. The equation of motion for the inflaton field reads \footnote{see section \ref{sec:motion_of_the_axion_field} for the derivation of equation of motion of scalar fields in a expanding universe.}:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:inflaton_field_eq}
	\ddot{\phi} + 3 H \dot{\phi} + \Gamma_\mathrm{inf} \dot{\phi} + V'(\phi) = 0.
\end{equation}
The energy density is given by the energy density of the inflaton field
and standard model radiation:
\begin{align}
	\rho_\mathrm{inf} &= \frac{1}{2} \dot{\phi}^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_\mathrm{inf}^2 \phi^2 \\
	\rho &= \rho_\mathrm{inf} + \rho_\mathrm{rad}.
\end{align}


The term $\Gamma_\mathrm{inf}$ is a phenomenological term describing the decay of the inflaton field into standard model particles, as we will see shortly. In this thesis we are interested in the epoch after the inflaton starts oscillating and decays into standard model particles. This epoch is called reheating.
If we multiply eq. \eqref{eq:inflaton_field_eq} with $\dot{\phi}$ and average over one oscillation, we obtain
the equation for reheating:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:cont_eq_inf}
	\boxed{
	\dot{\rho}_\mathrm{inf} + 3 H \rho_\mathrm{inf} = - \Gamma_\mathrm{inf} \rho_\mathrm{inf}
	}
\end{equation}
The corresponding equation for the radiation energy density reads
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:cont_eq_rad}
	\boxed{
	\dot{\rho}_\mathrm{rad} + 4 H \rho_\mathrm{rad} = + \Gamma_\mathrm{inf} \rho_\mathrm{inf}
	}
\end{equation}
The replacement $4 \to 3$ comes from the different scaling of the energy density from the expansion. The change of sign on the right-hand-side comes from the direction of the decay. Here one can see the effect of the $\Gamma_{\mathrm{inf}}$ term: it creates an effective decay term in the rate equations.
These equations together with the Friedmann equation, describe the background cosmology for our later computations.
Finally we have to fix our initial conditions for these equations.
At the end of inflation, no radiation has been produced yet, hence it is vanishing.
The inflaton field dominates the energy density of the universe and hence we get its energy density from the Hubble parameter at the end of inflation via the Friedmann equation.
In formulas:
\begin{align}
	\rho_\mathrm{inf}(t_\mathrm{inf}) &= 3 M_\mathrm{pl}^2 H_\mathrm{inf}^2 \nonumber \\
	\rho_\mathrm{rad}(t_\mathrm{inf}) &= 0.
\end{align}
After the end of inflation the inflaton field will still dominate the energy density, hence the universe is matter dominated. This ends once the energy density of radiation is the same as the energy density of the inflaton field.
The temperature at this time is called the reheating temperature $T_\mathrm{RH}$.
Note that this is not the maximal temperature reached.
It is given by \cite[eq. 8.34]{the_early_universe_kolb_and_turner}
\begin{align}
	T_\mathrm{RH} = 0.55 g_*^{-1/4} (8 \pi M_\mathrm{pl}  \Gamma_\mathrm{inf}).
\end{align}
This temperature gives the energy scale of processes during the reheating epoch.


\section{Baryogenesis}
In this section we will introduce the problem for which this thesis investigates a possible solution.
The problem of baryogenesis can be expressed as follows: Why does the universe contain so much baryonic-matter? Or more precisely: The universe as observed today, is made up of matter with very little antimatter, while in earlier times both were present in high numbers being in chemical equilibrium. As the universe cooled down, most of matter and antimatter annihilated into photons. Therefore it is reasonable to express the amount of matter-antimatter asymmetry by the ratio of the effective baryon number and the number of photons:
\begin{equation}
	\eta_B = \frac{n_+ - n_-}{n_\gamma},
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
	n_\gamma = 2 \frac{\zeta(3)}{\pi^2} T^3.
\end{equation}
The dependence on the expansion in $\eta_b$ cancels out.
Only a comparatively small number of baryons survived in the end.
For lower energies we know that baryon number is a conserved quantity. Hence the creation of the asymmetry needs to happen at high energies.
Note that during annihilation of baryons and antibaryons the comoving number of photons changes, hence over this epoch the asymmetry $\eta_B$ is not conversed. A better quantifier for the baryon-asymmetry
is the ratio to the entropy density:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:baryon_abundance}
	Y_B := \frac{n_B}{s}.
\end{equation}
The present-day asymmetry in relation to the photons number density can be expressed as \footnote{
One can derive this by considering $\frac{\eta_B}{Y_B} = \frac{\pi^4}{45 \zeta(3)} g_{*, s}(T)$.
In the standard model one finds $g_{*,s}^0 = 43/11$ and $g_{*, s}^{\gg 1 \, \mathrm{Gev}} = 427/4$ \cite[sec. 3.4]{the_early_universe_kolb_and_turner}.
}
\begin{equation}
	\eta_B^0 = \frac{g_{*,s}^0}{g_{*, s}^{\gg 1 \, \mathrm{Gev}}} \eta_B^{\gg 1 \, \mathrm{Gev}}.
\end{equation}
The observed value of the asymmetry is $\eta_B^0 = \eta_B^\mathrm{obs} = 10^{-6}$.

\subsection{Sakharov Conditions}
Andrei Sakharov formulated in 1967 three necessary conditions required for baryogenesis \cite{Sakharov_1991}.
The first one is that baryon number has to be violated in the process. We start from the assumption that the initial baryon asymmetry was vanishing as it was diluted by inflation.
Hence the baryon number as to the produced in a dynamical process.
The second one is less obvious: C and CP symmetries have to be broken.
This is required as only if
reactions exists that actually are biased toward the creation of baryons not anti-baryons an effective asymmetry can be produced.
For this to happen the reactions need to distinguish between matter and antimatter i.e. C and CP symmetries have a be broken.
Finally the process of baryogenesis has to happen out-of-equilibrium. This is because
in equilibrium the number densities only depend on the mass of the particles, which is the same of particles and their anti-partners by CPT symmetry.


\subsection{Baryogenesis in the Standard Model}
\label{sec:baryogenesis_in_the_standard_model}

Let us investigate these conditions in the known physics of the standard model (SM). While non-equilibrium and C / CP violation are know parts of the standard model, baryon number violations do not appear in the Feynman rules of SM interactions. In the standard model, the baryon and the lepton numbers are violated by the following non-perturbative term:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:B_and_L_current_equations}
	\partial_\mu J^\mu_B = \partial_\mu J^\mu_L = N_f \frac{g_2^2}{32 \pi^2} F^{\mu \nu}_a \tilde{F}_{\mu \nu}^a,
\end{equation}
where $g_2$ is the SU(2) coupling constant, $N_f$ the number of fermions, $F$ the SU(2) field strength tensor and $\tilde{F}$ its dual.
It can be written as the divergence of the Chern-Simons current:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:chern_simons_current}
	K^\mu = \epsilon^{\mu \alpha \beta \gamma} \left( A^a_\alpha F^a_{\beta \gamma} - \frac{g_2}{3} f^{abc} A^a_\alpha A^b_\beta A^c_\gamma \right),
\end{equation}
where $f^{abc}$ are the SU(2) structure constants, $A$ the SU(2) gauge field.
This shows that the term on the right hand side of \eqref{eq:B_and_L_current_equations} is a topological quantity as we can define a winding-number type quantity:
\begin{equation}
	N_{\mathrm{CS}} := \int \mathrm{d}^3 x \, K^0.
\end{equation}
Using the temporal gauge (defined by $A_0 = 0$), where $K_i = 0$,
we can write the change of Chern-Simons number between $t_i$ and $t_f$ as
\begin{equation}
	\int \mathrm{d}^4 x \partial_\mu K^\mu = \int \mathrm{d} t \, \partial_t \int \mathrm{d}^3 x \, K^0 =
	N_{\mathrm{CS}}(t_f) - N_{\mathrm{CS}}(t_i) = \Delta N_{\mathrm{CS}}(t_i, t_f)
\end{equation}
If the field configurations at $t_i$ and $_f$ are so called pure gauges i.e. configurations with vanishing energy-density (vaccum configurations) and hence vanishing field strength of the form
\begin{equation}
	A_\mu = U^{-1} A_\mu U + \frac{i}{g_2} U^{-1} \partial_\mu U,
\end{equation}
then the Chern-Simons number is an integer.
Hence one can not deform such vacuum configurations into each other without leaving the set of vacuum configurations.
The change between them is hence a quantum tunneling process which is called an instanton \footnote{
The formal definition of an instanton is that they are solutions of the classical equations of motion with finite energy in euclidean space-time. They have to go to a vacuum configuration for $t \to \pm \infty$ for the energy to be finite. Hence one can expand the path integral for the transition rate between the vacua around this instanton configuration to obtain an approximate result. This technique is discussed in ref. \cite[chap. 7]{aspects_of_symmmetry}. Still one also calls the quantum tunneling process an instanton.
}. See figure \ref{fig:sphaleron_cartoon} for an illustration.
Its rate is too low to have any significant effect, although this changes once we consider thermal processes i.e. so called sphalerons \footnote{
Similarly a sphaleron is defined to be a static i.e. time-independent solution of the classical equations of motions which maximizes (or is a saddle point) i.e. is not a minimum of the energy.
The rate of thermal transitions can then be computed using the energy of the sphaleron configuration as it gives the height of the potential barrier between vaccua.
Still the process of thermal transitions is called a sphaleron. Later one we will also call the kind of expression in the right hand side of eq. \eqref{eq:B_and_L_current_equations} a sphaleron.
}.
Below the electro-weak phase transition the rate is still exponentially suppressed but the energy barrier between vacua vanishes above the phase transition. Here the transition rate is given by \cite{sphaleron_rate_symmetric_phase_Moore_2011}
\begin{align}
	\Gamma_{\mathrm{sph}} &= (0.21 \pm 0.01) \left(\frac{N_c g^2 T}{m_D^2} \right) \left(\ln \left(\frac{m_D}{\gamma} \right) + 3.0410 \right) \frac{N_c^2 - 1}{N_c^2} (N_c \sqrt{2 \pi g})^5 T^4 \\
	\gamma &= \frac{N_c g^2 T}{4 \pi} \left(\ln \left(\frac{m_D}{\gamma}\right) + 3.0410 \right) \nonumber \\
	m_D^2 &= \frac{2N_c + N_f}{6} g^2 T^2 \nonumber,
\end{align}
where $N_c$ the number of ``colors'' ($N_c = 2$ for the weak SU(2) theory) and $g = g_2$ the coupling constant.
These processes give us the rate of conversion of lepton and baryon numbers.

\chapter{Spontaneous Baryogenesis}
\label{sec:spontaneous_baryogenesis}
\label{sec:sbg}

In this chapter we will discuss a possible mechanism which can implement baryogenesis. This mechanism is called spontaneous baryogenesis and is the topic of the rest of this thesis.

The mechanism of spontaneous baryogenesis was propose by Andreq Cohen and David Kapla in 1987 in \cite{COHEN1987251} and \cite{COHEN1988913}.
Their idea was to couple a scalar field $\phi$ to the baryon current $J_B$:
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} (\partial \phi)^2 - V(\phi) - \frac{1}{f} \partial_\mu \phi J_B^\mu.
\end{equation}
If one considers the corresponding path-integral for the thermal theory, the time derivative in this coupling appears as a modification of the baryon chemical potential:
\begin{equation}
	\mu \to \mu_\mathrm{eff} = \mu + \frac{\dot{\phi}}{f}.
\end{equation}
This in turn modifies the equilibrium abundance of baryons, depending on the sign of $\dot{\phi}$.
In a cosmological setting, a scalar field is frozen until its mass exceeds the Hubble-friction (see \ref{sec:motion_of_the_axion_field} for details on this). The initial fast-roll motion creates baryons. Then the successive oscillations create baryons and antibaryons in alternation canceling each other, without creating a net baryon number.
There are different ways to create a concrete implementation of spontaneous baryogenesis.
The one we will look at in this thesis is using axions.
Axions have couplings to topological terms like
\begin{equation}
	 \sim \phi(t) F \tilde{F}.
\end{equation}
From eq. \eqref{eq:B_and_L_current_equations} we can see that this creates a direct coupling to the lepton current.
Then, by the means of sphalerons (see section \ref{sec:baryogenesis_in_the_standard_model}), the leptons are converted into baryons.

In ref. \cite{Domcke:2020kcp_Generic_Couplings} the authors pointed out that a direct coupling to the lepton or baryon current is not necessary for successful baryogenesis.
Instead the creation of some charge X deviating from the equilibrium value, leeds to a non-vanishing baryon number if the reactions which equilibrate the charge X back, are violating baryon number. Hence in the process a net baryon number is created.
Let us discuss this using an abstract example in more detail.
We are considering two charges $Q_1$ and $Q_2$. The baryon number is given by the linear combination
\begin{equation}
	B = Q_1 + Q_2.
\end{equation}
Our toy theory contains two interactions: $O_1$, which changes $Q_1$ by $-1$ and $Q_2$ by $+1$ and $O_2$, which changes $Q_1$ by $+1$. In equations, the current equations for this theory are:
\begin{align}
	\partial_\mu J_1^\mu &= O_2 - O_1 \\
	\partial_\mu J_2^\mu &= O_1 \nonumber.
\end{align}
Hence the current equation for the baryon current reads
\begin{equation}
	\partial_\mu J_B^\mu = O_2.
\end{equation}
The mechanism discussed so far would work by coupling the scalar field to the operator $O_2$, leading to a direct coupling of the scalar field to the baryon current. But in this example we couple it to $O_1$.
This coupling biases the value of $Q_2 - Q_1$ away from the previously vanishing equilibrium value.
At the same time, the operator $O_2$ will lead to a relaxation of $Q_1$ toward its vanishing equilibrium value. In doing so, it will violate also $B = Q_1 + Q_2$ as it doesn't change $Q_2$. Once this reaction freezes out, $B$ is conserved. Then $O_2$ will lead $Q_2 - Q_1$ to obtain its new vanishing equilibrium value with a non-vanishing $B$.
This process is shown in figure \ref{fig:sbg_cartoon}.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{figures/sbg_cartoon.pdf}
	\caption{Cartoon of the spontaneous baryogenesis process as described in the main text. This cartoon is taken from \cite[fig. 1]{Domcke:2020kcp_Generic_Couplings}.
	The operator $O_X$ corresponds to $O_2$ and $O_V$ to $O_1$.
	}
	\label{fig:sbg_cartoon}
\end{figure}

Why is this process called \emph{spontaneous} baryogenesis?
This is because the amount and also if baryons or antibaryons are generated depends on the initial value of the scalar field.
If in the UV-completion this scalar arises as the (pseudo-)Goldstone boson of the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of a complex field $\Phi$, then the initial values of $\phi$ are distributed evenly from the SSB, hence the name spontaneous baryogenesis.

Finally we have to find a way to compute the final asymmetry.
A simple approach is using Boltzmann equations. For example if we couple
the axion field directly to the lepton current and we have lepton number violating interaction in the thermal plasma mediated by the Weinberg operator (see sec. \ref{sec:lepton_number_violation_from_weinberg_operator})
then the Boltzmann equation reads:
\begin{equation}
	\dot{n}_L + 3 H n_L = - \Gamma_L (n_L - n_L^\mathrm{eq}),
\end{equation}
where $\Gamma_L$ is the rate for the Weinberg interaction.
This equation was used in ref. \cite{Kusenko_2015_Axion_Leptogenesis}.
However we would like to have a complete set of equations considering all standard model charges. The equation above assumes that these charges are all in equilibrium.
Moreover this approach has the problem that it depends on the field basis.
This problem was pointed out by ref. \cite{Shi_2015_Basis_Invariance_chemical_equilibrium}.
If we would start with an axion coupling to the weak sphaleron $a F \tilde{F}$, this Boltzmann equation is not correct. As this coupling is not directly modifying the lepton chemical potential. For this one needs a coupling to the lepton current.
To introduce a coupling to the lepton current from this coupling, one needs to do a field redefinition depending on the axion field. This would also change the fields in the Weinberg operator, introducing a coupling within the Weinberg operator, modifying its rate. While one could compute a rate for the Weinberg operator including the axion dependence and solve for the asymmetry correctly, its more fruitful to use a set of basis independent equations.
This was done in .ref \cite{Domcke:2020kcp_Generic_Couplings}, where the authors developed a formalism based on linear-response theory which can describe the equilibration of charges by interaction and generation of charges from coupling to an axion field in a basis independent way for generic couplings. We will now recap their derivation.

\chapter{The Transport Equation}
\label{sec:transport_equation}
A derivation of the transport equation can be found in \cite[appendix B]{Domcke:2020kcp_Generic_Couplings}.
However I did not understand this derivation fully. I developed this derivation on my own using the well known linear-response theory (here for quantum systems).
The starting point and the final result are the same.

We start from the current (continuity) equation for the charges $Q_i$ with current $J_i^\mu$. These charges are changed by interaction $O_\alpha$ by $n_i^\alpha$. Hence the current equations read:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:current_eq}
	\partial_\mu J_i^\mu = \sum_\alpha n_i^\alpha O_\alpha
\end{equation}
This equation is directly derived from the Lagrangian of the system and should be taken as an operator valued equation in the context of finite temperature QFT.
We want to take the expectation value in the grand-canonical ensemble as particle numbers are not conserved:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:current_eq_expectation_value}
	\partial_t \langle J_i^0 \rangle_{\mathrm{GC}} = \sum_\alpha n_i^\alpha \langle O_\alpha \rangle_{\mathrm{GC}}
\end{equation}
We are going to evaluate these expectation values in linear-response theory.
For this we take $H_s \equiv \sum_i \mu_i Q_i$ as a perturbation to the Hamiltonian of the system.
Here the $\mu_i$ are the sources, which change slowly compared to the charges $Q_i$.
Let us first derive the equation for linear perturbation theory in general and then apply is first to the perturbation by chemical potentials $\mu_i$ and then to the perturbation by the classical axion field $a(t)$.

\section{Quantum Linear Response Theory}
We work in the interaction-picture, where the time-evolution of the density matrix $\rho(t)$ of the system is given by
\begin{equation}
    \rho(t) = U(t) \rho_0 U^{-1}(t).
\end{equation}
The interaction-picture time-evolution operator $U(t)$ is given by
\begin{equation}
    U(t) = T \, \exp \left[ - i \int_{-\infty}^t  \mathrm{d} t' H_s(t') \right].
\end{equation}
We now evaluate an arbitrary observable $A_i$ with this density matrix in linear order of perturbation theory:
\begin{align}
	\label{eq:linear_response}
    \langle A_i \rangle &= \operatorname{Tr} \left[ \rho(t) A_i(t) \right] \nonumber \\
    &= \operatorname{Tr} \left[ U(t) \rho_0 U^{-1}(t) A_i(t) \right] \nonumber \\
    &= \operatorname{Tr} \left[ \rho_0 U^{-1}(t) A_i(t) U(t) \right] \nonumber \\
    &\approx \operatorname{Tr} \left[ \rho_0 (1 + i \int_{-\infty}^t \mathrm{d} t' H_s(t')) A_i(t) (1 - i \int_{-\infty}^t \mathrm{d} t' H_s(t')) \right] \nonumber \\
    &\approx \operatorname{Tr} \left[ \rho_0 (A_i(t) + i \int_{-\infty}^t \mathrm{d} t' [H_s(t'), A_i(t)] ) \right] \nonumber \\
    &= \langle A_i \rangle_c + i \int_{-\infty}^t \mathrm{d} t' \langle [H_s(t'), A_i(t)] \rangle_c \nonumber \\
    &= \langle A_i \rangle_c + i \int_{-\infty}^t \mathrm{d} t' \langle [\sum_j \phi_j(t') A_j(t'), A_i(t)] \rangle_c  \nonumber \\
    &= \langle A_i \rangle_c + i \sum_j \int_{-\infty}^t \mathrm{d} t' \phi_j(t') \langle [A_j(t'), A_i(t)] \rangle_c
\end{align}
The final result is the Kudo-formula \footnote{See \url{https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/kintheory/four.pdf} for David Tong's lecture notes on the topic.}.


\subsection{Perturbation by Small Chemical Potentials}
Now we can apply this result to the chemical potentials.
We want to take the exception values of the interaction operators $O_\alpha$ in eq. \eqref{eq:current_eq_expectation_value}.
Here the chemical potentials $\mu_i$ are the sources and they are coupled to the charges $Q_i$.
Hence the linear response equations reads
\begin{equation}
	\langle O_\alpha(t, x) \rangle = i \sum_j \int_{-\infty}^t \mathrm{d} t' \mu_j(t') \langle [Q_j(t'), O_\alpha(t, x)] \rangle_c.
\end{equation}
Here we have used that $\langle O_\alpha(t) \rangle_c = 0$.
Now we are going to insert the charges in terms of the time component of the four-current:
\begin{equation}
	Q_i(t) = \int \mathrm{d}^3 x J^0_i(t, x)
\end{equation}
and insert a dummy integration to write the equation in terms of the time derivative of the charge density $\dot{J^0_i}$ and finally replace it with the right-hand-side of the current eq. \eqref{eq:current_eq}:
\begin{align}
	\langle O_\alpha(t, x) \rangle &= i \sum_j \int_{-\infty}^t \mathrm{d} t' \mu_j(t') \langle [\int \mathrm{d}^3 x' J^0_j(t', x'), O_\alpha(t, x)] \rangle_c \nonumber \\
	&= i \sum_j \int_{-\infty}^t \mathrm{d} t' \int \mathrm{d}^3 x'  \mu_j(t') \langle [\int^{t'}_{-\infty} \ \mathrm{d} t'' \frac{\partial}{\partial t''} J^0_j(t'', x'), O_\alpha(t, x)] \rangle_c \nonumber \\
	&= i \sum_j \int_{-\infty}^t \mathrm{d} t' \int \mathrm{d}^3 x'  \mu_j(t') \langle [\int^{t'}_{-\infty} \ \mathrm{d} t'' \sum_\beta n^\beta_j O_\beta(t'', x'), O_\alpha(t, x)] \rangle_c \nonumber \\
	&= i \sum_{j, \beta} \int_{-\infty}^t \mathrm{d} t' \int \mathrm{d}^3 x' \int^{t'}_{-\infty} \ \mathrm{d} t'' \mu_j(t') n^\beta_j \langle [ O_\beta(t'', x'), O_\alpha(t)] \rangle_c
\end{align}
Finally we use the assumption that the chemical potentials change slowly compared to the charges
\begin{equation}
	\langle O_\alpha(t, x) \rangle = i \sum_{j, \beta} \mu_j(t) n^\beta_j  \int_{-\infty}^t \mathrm{d} t' \int \mathrm{d}^3 x' \int^{t'}_{-\infty} \ \mathrm{d} t'' \langle [ O_\beta(t'', x'), O_\alpha(t, x)] \rangle_c.
\end{equation}
This equation can now be expressed in terms of the spectral functions
\begin{equation}
	G_{\alpha \beta}(t - t', x - x') \equiv \langle [ O_\alpha(t, x), O_\beta(t', x')] \rangle_{c}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}G_{\alpha \beta}(\omega, p) \equiv \int \mathrm{d}^3 x \, \mathrm{d} t \, e^{i \omega t - i p \cdot x} G_{\alpha, \beta}(t, x)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}G_{\alpha \beta}(t, x) = \int \frac{\mathrm{d}^3 p \, \mathrm{d} \omega}{2 \pi} \, e^{- i \omega t + i p \cdot x} G_{\alpha \beta}(\omega, p).
\end{equation}
as
\begin{equation}
	\langle O_\alpha(t, x) \rangle = i \sum_{j, \beta} \mu_j(t) n^\beta_j  \int_{-\infty}^t \mathrm{d} t' \int \mathrm{d}^3 x' \int^{t'}_{-\infty} \ \mathrm{d} t'' G_{\alpha \beta}(t - t'', x - x')
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\langle O_\alpha(t) \rangle = i \sum_{j, \beta} \mu_j(t) n^\beta_j  \int_{-\infty}^t \mathrm{d} t' \int \mathrm{d}^3 x' \int^{t'}_{-\infty} \ \mathrm{d} t''
	\int \frac{\mathrm{d}^3 p \, \mathrm{d} \omega}{2 \pi} \, e^{- i \omega (t - t'') + i p \cdot x'} G_{\alpha \beta}(\omega, p).
\end{equation}
We are now going to evaluate most of the integrals in this expression. Here we are commiting some crimes against maths! First we use the cancellations between the $x$ and the $p$ integrals and then isolate and finally solve the $t$ integrals:
\begin{align}
	& \int_{-\infty}^t \mathrm{d} t' \int \mathrm{d}^3 x' \int^{t'}_{-\infty} \ \mathrm{d} t''
	\int \frac{\mathrm{d}^3 p \, \mathrm{d} \omega}{2 \pi} \, e^{- i \omega (t - t'') + i p \cdot x'} G_{\alpha \beta}(\omega, p) \nonumber \\
	= & \int \frac{\mathrm{d} \omega}{2 \pi} G_{\alpha \beta}(\omega, 0) \int_{-\infty}^t \mathrm{d} t' \int^{t'}_{-\infty} \ \mathrm{d} t''
	\, e^{- i \omega (t - t'')}  \nonumber \\
	= & - \int \frac{\mathrm{d} \omega}{2 \pi} \frac{G_{\alpha \beta}(\omega, 0)} {\omega^2}
\end{align}
Plugging this back into the expression for the expectation value yields:
\begin{equation}
	\langle O_\alpha(t) \rangle = \sum_{j, \beta} \mu_j(t) n^\beta_j \int \frac{\mathrm{d} \omega}{2 \pi} \frac{G_{\alpha \beta}(\omega, 0)} { \omega (\omega + i \epsilon)} =  \sum_{j} \mu_j(t) n^\alpha_j \frac{G_{\alpha \alpha}(\omega, 0)}{2 \omega} \Big|_{w = 0}.
	\label{eq:chemical_potentials_linear_response}
\end{equation}
Here we have used that
\begin{equation}
	\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \frac{\mathrm{d} \omega}{2\pi i} \frac{1}{\omega^2} G_{\alpha \beta}(\omega, 0) = \frac{1}{2} \int_l \frac{\mathrm{d} \omega}{2\pi i} \frac{1}{\omega} \frac{G_{\alpha \beta}(\omega, 0)}{\omega} = \frac{G_{\alpha \beta}(\omega, 0)}{2 \omega} \Big|_{\omega = 0} \underbrace{\operatorname{Res}_{\omega = 0} \frac{1}{\omega}}_{= 1},
\end{equation}
where $l$ is the contour from $+\infty$ to zero and back.

\subsection{Source from Classical Axion Field}
Now we turn to the source from the axion field $a(t)$.
This time our perturbation Hamiltonian reads
\begin{equation}
	H_s(t) = \frac{a(t)}{f_a} \int \mathrm{d}^3 x \, O_\beta(t, x).
\end{equation}
We again use eq. \eqref{eq:linear_response} to obtain the linear response result
\begin{equation}
	\langle O_\alpha(t) \rangle_{GC, a \ne 0} = \langle O_\alpha \rangle_{GC, a = 0} + i \int_{-\infty}^t \mathrm{d}^4 x' \frac{a(t')}{f_a} \langle [ O_\beta(x'), O_\alpha(x)] \rangle_c.
\end{equation}
Note that the expectation values with the GC (grand-canonical ensemble) subscript are taken using the linear response result with the chemical potentials.
Finally we use the assumption that the axion field changes slowly compared to the charges. In this case we are allowed to expand the axion field
around time $t$ as
\begin{equation}
	a(t') = a(t) + \dot{a}(t)(t' - t).
\end{equation}
This yields:
\begin{align}
	 &\langle O_\alpha(t) \rangle_{GC, a \ne 0} - \langle O_\alpha  \rangle_{GC, a = 0} = - i \frac{a_0}{f_a} \int_{-\infty}^t \mathrm{d}^4 x' G_{\alpha \beta}(x') - i \frac{\dot{a}}{f_a} \int_{-\infty}^t \mathrm{d}^4 x' G_{\alpha \beta}(x') (t - t')
	 \nonumber \\
	 &= - \frac{a_0}{f_a} \int_{-\infty}^t \mathrm{d} t' \int \mathrm{d} \omega \frac{e^{i \omega (t - t') - i p x'}}{(2\pi)^4} G_{\alpha \beta}(\omega, 0)
	 -i \frac{\dot{a}_0}{f_a} \int_{-\infty}^t \mathrm{d} t' \underbrace{\int \frac{\mathrm{d} \omega}{2 \pi} G_{\alpha \beta}(\omega, 0) \underbrace{(t - t') e^{i \omega (t - t')}}_{= -i \partial_\omega e^{i \omega (t - t')}}}_{= - \int \mathrm{d} \omega \partial_\omega G_{\alpha \beta}(\omega, 0) e^{i \omega (t - t')}}
	 \nonumber \\
	 &= - \frac{a_0}{f_a} \int \mathrm{d} \omega \frac{1}{2 \pi \omega} G_{\alpha \beta}(\omega, 0) - i \frac{\dot{a}_0}{f_a} \int \mathrm{d} \omega \underbrace{\partial_\omega \frac{1}{\omega}}_{= - \frac{1}{\omega^2}} G_{\alpha \beta}(\omega, 0) \nonumber \\
	 &= - \frac{a_0}{f_a} \int \frac{\mathrm{d} \omega}{2 \pi} \frac{1}{\omega} G_{\alpha \beta}(\omega, 0) - \frac{\dot{a}_0}{f_a} \frac{G_{\alpha \alpha}}{2 \omega} \Big|_{\omega = 0}.
	 \label{eq:axion_source_term_linear_response}
\end{align}
As ref. \cite{Domcke:2020kcp_Generic_Couplings} we neglect the first term.

\subsection{Putting Everything Together}
Finally we can put all of these things together.
For this we define the rate for the interaction $O_\alpha$ as
\begin{equation}
	\Gamma_\alpha \equiv - \frac{T G_\alpha(\omega, 0)}{2\omega} \Big|_{\omega = 0}.
\end{equation}
When we substitute the expectation value for the perturbation from chemical potentials into the expectation value for the perturbation from the axion field, find that
\begin{equation}
	\langle O_\alpha(x) \rangle_{GC, a \ne 0} = - \Gamma_\alpha \left[ \sum_j n_j^\alpha \frac{\mu_j}{T} + n_S^\alpha \frac{\dot{a}}{f_a T} \right].
\end{equation}
Here the source-vector $n_S^\alpha$ is one if the axion couples to operator $O_\alpha$ and zero if not.
Inserting this into the expectation value of the current equation \eqref{eq:current_eq_expectation_value} yields
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:transport_eq_1}
	\dot{q}_i = - \sum_\alpha n^\alpha_i \Gamma_\alpha \left[ \sum_j n_j^\alpha \frac{\mu_j}{T} + n_S^\alpha \frac{\dot{a}}{f_a T} \right].
\end{equation}
Furthermore we can express the charge densities $q_i$ in terms of the chemical potentials
\begin{equation}
	q_i = g_i \mu_i \frac{T^2}{6},
\end{equation}
where $g_i$ is the number of degrees of freedom of the particle associated with charge $i$.
Also we want to work on a FLRW background and hence change the time-derivative to
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t} \to \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t} + 3 H.
\end{equation}
Then the left-hand-side of \eqref{eq:transport_eq_1} reads
\begin{equation}
	\dot{q}_i + 3 H q_i = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t} \left( g_i \mu_i \frac{T^2}{6} \right) + 3 H g_i \mu_i \frac{T^2}{6} = \frac{g_i}{6} \left[ \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t} \left( \frac{\mu_i}{T} \right) T^3 + \frac{\mu_i}{T} \dot{T} 3 T^2 + 3 H \left( \frac{\mu_i}{T} \right) T^3 \right].
\end{equation}
Using this and dividing by $g_i / 6 T^3$ yields our final form of the transport equation. We obtain
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:transport_equation}
	\boxed{
	\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t} \left( \frac{\mu_i}{T} \right) = - \frac{1}{g_i} \sum_\alpha n^\alpha_i \frac{\Gamma_\alpha}{T^3 / 6} \left[ \sum_j n_j^\alpha \left( \frac{\mu_j}{T} \right) + n_S^\alpha \frac{\dot{a}}{f_a T} \right] - 3 \left( \frac{\mu_i}{T} \right) \left[ \frac{\dot{T}}{T} + H \right].
	}
\end{equation}

\section{Basis Independence of the Transport Equation}

In section \ref{sec:sbg} we claimed that the transport equation will give us a description for the dynamics of charges independent of the field basis.
Let's prove that this is actually the case.
For this we follow \cite[sec. 2.2 ]{Domcke:2020kcp_Generic_Couplings}.
We consider the source term of eq. \eqref{eq:transport_equation}
\begin{equation}
	S_i := \frac{1}{g_i} \frac{\dot{a}}{f_a T} \sum_\alpha \frac{\Gamma_\alpha}{T^3 / 6} n_i^\alpha n_S^\alpha
\end{equation}
We start with a direct coupling to a current $J_k$ and rotated the fields such that
\begin{equation}
	- \frac{a}{f} \partial_\mu J^\mu_k \to - \frac{a}{f} \sum_\beta n_k^\beta O_\beta.
\end{equation}
The current coupling acts as discussed before like a chemical potential. Hence
\begin{equation}
	n_S^\alpha = n_k^\alpha.
\end{equation}
We see immediately that this is the same as $n_S^\alpha$ for the linear combination of operators.


\section{Charges and Rates in the Standard Model}
\label{sec:charges_and_rates_in_the_standard_model}
So far we have derived the transport equation for a general set of charges $q_i$ and interactions $O_\alpha$. In this section we will specify these quantities for the standard model, which we will use later to compute the baryon asymmetry.
We take these from \cite[sec. 3.1]{Domcke:2020kcp_Generic_Couplings}

First let us summaries all charges present in the standard model:

	\end{center}
	\label{tab:charges_of_the_sm}
\end{table}
These charges can change in sphalerons and Yukawa interactions. As in ref. \cite{Domcke:2020kcp_Generic_Couplings}, we neglect flavor changing Yukawa interactions.
The processes are:
\begin{table}[H]
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{llll}
			Name & Symbol & Rate & Charge Vector \\
			\hline
			Electro-Weak Sphaleron & WS & $\Gamma_\mathrm{WS} = \frac{\kappa_\mathrm{WS}}{2} \alpha_2^5 T^4$ & $\sum_i n_i^\mathrm{WS} \mu_i = \sum_f (\mu_{L_f} + 3 \mu_{Q_f})$ \\
			Strong Sphaleron & SS & $\Gamma_\mathrm{WS} = \frac{\kappa_\mathrm{SS}}{2} \alpha_3^5 T^4$ & $\sum_i n_i^\mathrm{SS} \mu_i = \sum_f (2\mu_{Q_f} - \mu_{u_f} - \mu_{d_f})$ \\
			Lepton Yukawa & $Y_l^{ff}$ & $\Gamma_{Y_l^{ff}} = \kappa_{Y_e}(\alpha_2) y_{e_f} T^4$ & $\sum_i n_i^{Y_l^{ff}} \mu_i = - \mu_{e_f} + \mu_{L_f} - \mu_H$ \\
			Quark Yukawa up-type & $Y_u^{ff}$ & $\Gamma_{Y_u^{ff}} = \kappa_{Y_u}(\alpha_2, \alpha_3) y_{u_f}^2 T^4$ & $ \sum_i n_i^{Y_u^{ff}} \mu_i = - \mu_{u_f} + \mu_{Q_f} + \mu_H$ \\
			Quark Yukawa down-type & $Y_d^{ff}$ & $\Gamma_{Y_d^{ff}} = \kappa_{Y_d}(\alpha_2, \alpha_3) y_{d_f}^2 T^4$ & $ \sum_i n_i^{Y_d^{ff}} \mu_i = - \mu_{d_f} + \mu_{Q_f} - \mu_H$ \\
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
	\label{tab:interactions_in_the_sm}
\end{table}
where the parameters in the reaction rates are given by:
\begin{table}[H]
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{l}
			$\kappa_\mathrm{WS} \approx 24$ for $T \approx 10^{12} \, \mathrm{GeV}$ \\
			$\kappa_\mathrm{SS} \approx 2.7 \times 10^2$ for $T \approx 10^{13} \, \mathrm{GeV}$ \\
			$\kappa_{Y_l} \approx 1.7 \times 10^{-3}$ \\
			$\kappa_{Y_u} \approx 1.0 \times 10^{-2}$ for $T \approx 10^{12} \, \mathrm{GeV}$ \\
			$\kappa_{Y_d} \approx \kappa_{Y_u}$ \\
			$Y_\tau = 1 \times 10^{-2}$ \\
			$Y_\mathrm{top} = 0.49$ \\
			$Y_\mathrm{bottom} = 6.8 \times 10^{-3}$ \\
			SU(2) feinstructure constant $\alpha_2 \approx 0.024$ \\
			SU(3) feinstructure constant $\alpha_3 \approx 0.028$ \\
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
\end{table}
Finally we can simplify the charges for the high temperature regime of $T > 10^{12} \, \mathrm{GeV}$. Here first and second generation leptons and quarks are indistinguishable as their Yukawa couplings are small compared to the temperature.
Hence we combine their charges to have the same chemical potential. We end up with the following charges:
\begin{table}[H]
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{lll}
			Symbol & Definition & dof. $g_i$ \\
			\hline
			$\tau$ & right handed tau &1  \\
			$L_{12}$ & left handed first and second gen. leptons & 4 \\
			$L_3$ & third gen. lepton& 2 \\
			$q_{12}$ & right handed first and second gen. quarks & 12 \\
			$t$ & right handed top quark & 3 \\
			$b$ & tight handed bottom quark & 3 \\
			$Q_{12}$ & left handed first and second gen. quarks & 12 \\
			$Q_3$ & left handed third gen. quark  & 6 \\
			$H$ & Higgs doublet & 4 \\
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
\end{table}
In this basis the charge vectors for the interaction read:
\begin{table}[H]
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{ll}
			Interaction Name & Charge Vector $n^\alpha_i$ \\
			\hline
			weak sphaleron & $(0,2,1,0,0,0,6,3,0)$ \\
			strong sphaleron & $(0,0,0,-4,-1,-1,4,2,0)$ \\
			tau Yukawa & $(-1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1)$ \\
			top Yukawa & $(0,0,0,0,-1,0,0,1,1)$ \\
			bottom Yukawa & $(0,0,0,0,0,-1,0,1,-1)$ \\

\section{Lepton Number Violation from Weinberg Operator}
\label{sec:lepton_number_violation_from_weinberg_operator}

The Weinberg operator it the lowest-order operator, which is introduced in an effective field theory approach to the standard model, which violates lepton number \cite[sec. 5]{Domcke:2020kcp_Generic_Couplings}.
It is given as
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{Weinberg} = - \frac{m_v}{2 \nu_\mathrm{EW}^2} [H \cdot C \bar{L}_i] [L_i \cdot H]+ \, \mathrm{h.c.},
\end{equation}
where $m_v$ is the left handed neutrino mass, $\nu_\mathrm{EW} = 174 \, \mathrm{GeV}$ is the Higgs vacuum expectation value,
$L_i$ the ith left-handed lepton doublet and $H$ the Higgs doublet.
The notation $C$ means charge conjunction and is given for some spinor $\psi$ as
\begin{equation}
	C \psi = i \gamma^2 \gamma^0 (\bar{\psi})^T
\end{equation}
where $\bar{\psi}$ is the Dirac adjoint spinor of the spinor $\psi$ given by
\begin{equation}
	\bar{\psi} = \psi^\dagger \gamma^0.
\end{equation}
The $\gamma^\mu$ are the gamma matrices.
From these definitions we see that the Weinberg operator violates lepton number by $\Delta L = 2$.
It is parameterized by a mass of a left-handed neutrino as it can be realized by right-handed neutrinos in the seesaw mechanism, where the masses of right-handed neutrinos are related to the left-handed neutrinos and one finds an effective Weinberg operator of the above form.
Its rate is given by
\begin{align}
	\Gamma_\mathrm{W} = \kappa_W\frac{m_\nu^2 T^6}{\nu_\mathrm{EW}^4},
\end{align}
where $\kappa_\mathrm{W} = 3 \times 10^{-3}$.
For this project we assume a neutrino mass of
\begin{equation}
	m_\nu = 0.05 \, \mathrm{eV}.
\end{equation}
The charge vector of the Weinberg operator for the combined first and second generation leptons and the third generation leptons are given as
\begin{align}
	n^{W_{12}}_i &= (0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,2) \nonumber \\
	n^{W_{3}}_i &= (0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,2).
\end{align}
The rate for the combined first two generations is the twice the rate of a single Weinberg operator.

\section{Couplings of the Axion}
Finally we discuss the possible couplings for the axion field $a$. As it is by definition shift-symmetric, the allowed couplings are to a current
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{axion-coupling} = \frac{a}{f_a} \partial_\mu J^\mu_i
\end{equation}
and to an anomaly
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L}_\mathrm{axion-coupling} = \frac{a}{f_a} F_{\mu \nu}^{ab} \tilde{F}_{ab}^{\mu \nu}.
\end{equation}
Here $J$ is some current and $F$ the field strength tensor of some Yang-Mills field.
The first coupling is shift-symmetric as we can perform a partial integration in the action and move the derivative to the axion.
The second coupling is shift symmetric because it can be rewritten in terms of a coupling of the first kind.
In particular we consider couplings to the weak sphaleron where the field strength tensor is the electro-weak SU(2) field strength tensor,
a direct coupling to the $B - L$ current and to the strong-sphaleron where the field strength tensor is the SU(3) field strength tensor of QCD.
For these couplings the source vectors are:
\begin{align}
    (n_S^{WS} )^\alpha &= (1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)\nonumber \\
	(n_S^{B-L})^\alpha &= (0, 0, 0, 0, -2, -2) \nonumber \\
	(n_S^{SS} )^\alpha &= (0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0).
\end{align}


\chapter{Motion of the Axion Field}
\label{sec:motion_of_the_axion_field}

In this chapter we will discuss the models for axion-like fields and their cosmological dynamics.
An overview of cosmological axion fields can be found in \cite{MarshAxionCosmo}.
First let us discuss some generalities common to different models.

\section{Generalities}

\subsection{Equation of Motion for Cosmological Scalar Fields}
We start from the action of (multiple) scalar fields $\phi_i$ on some background with metric $g^{\mu \nu}$:
\begin{equation}
	S[\{\phi\}] = \int \mathrm{d}^4 x \sqrt{-g} \left[- \frac{1}{2} \sum_i (\partial \phi_i)^2 - V(\{\phi\}) \right].
\end{equation}
The corresponding equation of motion reads:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:klein_gordon_general_background}
	\Box \phi_i \equiv \frac{1}{\sqrt{-g}} \partial_\mu \sqrt{-g} g^{\mu \nu} \partial_\nu \phi_i = \frac{\partial V(\{\phi\})}{\partial \phi_i}.
\end{equation}
We are only interested in the FLRW metric discussed in section \ref{sec:dynamics_of_the_examsion_of_the_universe}.
Let us compute the determinant of this metric
\begin{equation}
	g = \det g_{\mu \nu} = -1 \cdot \frac{a(t)^2}{1 - kr^2} \cdot a(t)^2 r^2 \cdot a(t)^2 r^2 \sin^2 \theta = - a(t)^6 f(\mathbf{x})
\end{equation}
as well as the box operator defined in eq. \eqref{eq:klein_gordon_general_background} for this metric:
\begin{align}
	    \Box \phi_i
	    &= - \frac{1}{\sqrt{a(t)^6 f(\vec{x})}} (\partial_t \sqrt{ a(t)^6 f(\vec{x}) }) \dot{\phi_i} - \ddot{\phi_i}
	    = - \frac{\partial_t a(t)^3}{a(t)^3} \dot{\phi_i} - \ddot{\phi_i} \nonumber \\
	    &= - \frac{\dot{a}(t) \cdot 3 a(t)^2}{a(t)^3} \dot{\phi_i} - \ddot{\phi_i}
	    = - 3 \frac{\dot{a}}{a} \dot{\phi_i} - \ddot{\phi_i}
	    = - 3H \dot{\phi_i} - \ddot{\phi_i}.
\end{align}
In this thesis we assume that all fields are homogeneous after inflation and hence neglect the spacial derivatives.
This gives us the equation of motion for scalar fields in an expanding universe:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:scalar_field_eom}
	\boxed{
	\ddot{\phi_i} + 3 H \dot{\phi_i} + V'(\{\phi\}) = 0.
	}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Slow Roll Approximation}
\label{sec:slow_roll_approximation}
We will now consider only one scalar field $\phi$ and we seek an approximation for early times (this derivation is based on \cite[appendix A]{early_scalar_field_dynamics_PhysRevD.84.123506}) where the dynamics is dominated by Hubble friction i.e. the term $\sim H(t) \dot{\phi}$.
One starts with the following Ansatz:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:slow_roll_approx_eom}
	c H \dot{\phi} \simeq - \frac{\partial V}{\partial \phi}
\end{equation}
for constant parameter $c$.
To find an expression for $c$ we want to compare this approximation to the full equation of motion. Hence we take the time-derivative of the approximation. This yields:
\begin{equation}
	c \dot{H} \dot{\phi} + c H \ddot{\phi} + \dot{\phi} V''(\phi) = 0.
\end{equation}
By rearranging terms to
\begin{equation}
	c H \ddot{\phi} + \left(\frac{\dot{H}}{H} + \frac{V''}{c H}\right) \dot{\phi} = 0
\end{equation}
add addding \eqref{eq:slow_roll_approx_eom} we find
\begin{equation}
	\ddot{\phi} + \left( cH + \frac{\dot{H}}{H} + \frac{V''}{c H} \right) \dot{\phi} + V'(\phi) = 0.
\end{equation}
This equation is the same as the full equation of motion \eqref{eq:scalar_field_eom} apart from the friction term,
which allows us to compare the two:
\begin{equation}
	3 H = c H + \frac{\dot{H}}{H} + \frac{V''}{c H}.
\end{equation}
Solving for $c$ and using that
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\dot{H}}{H^2} = - \frac{3(w + 1)}{2}
\end{equation}
for a universe dominated by a fluid by an equation of state $w$ (see sec. \ref{sec:dynamics_of_the_examsion_of_the_universe}), we find
\begin{equation}
	c = 3 +\frac{3(w + 1)}{2} - \frac{V''}{c H^2}.
\end{equation}
This result shows that $c$ is indeed a constant as along as
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:slow_roll_condition}
	\left| \frac{V''}{c H^2} \right| \ll 1
\end{equation}
holds. This is the condition for the slow-roll solution to exist.

\subsection{WKB Approximation to Oscillations}
\label{sec:wkb_approximation}

In this section we want to derive the opposite approximation to the one derived in the last section.
This time we consider late times, where the axion potential dominates over the Hubble friction.
We will also assume that the potential is approximately harmonic i.e.
\begin{equation}
	V \approx \frac{1}{2} m_a^2 \phi^2.
\end{equation}
Formally our assumption here is that $H \ll V'' \Rightarrow \epsilon \sim H / m_a \ll 1$. Here $\epsilon$ is some auxillery small parameter.
Our Ansatz is of the WKB type and reads
\begin{equation}
	\phi(t) = A(t) \cos(\omega t + \delta),
\end{equation}
where $\delta$ is some phase, $\omega = m_a$ the oscillation frequency (consider to be constant for our proposes). The envelope function $A(t)$ varies slowly compared to the oscillation. The time-scale for the oscillation is $1/m_a$ and the time-scale for the envelope function is $A / \dot{A}$. Hence the condition on $A$ is $\epsilon \sim \dot{A} / (A m_a) \ll 1$.
Inserting this Ansatz into the equation of motion yields
\begin{equation}
	\ddot{A} c - 2 m_a \dot{A} s - m_a^2 A c + 3 H \dot{A} c - 3 H m_a A s + m_a^2 A c = 0,
\end{equation}
where we used the abbreviations $c = \cos(m_a t + \delta)$ and $s = \sin(m_a t + \delta)$.
Canceling the $m_a^2$ terms and dividing by $A m_a^2$ leads to
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\ddot{A}}{m_a^2 A} c - \frac{\dot{A}}{m_a A} 2 s + \frac{\dot{A}}{m_a} \frac{H}{m_a} 3 c - \frac{H}{m_a} 3 s = 0.
\end{equation}
Dropping all quadratic terms in $\epsilon$ yields:
\begin{equation}
	 - 2 m_a \dot{A} s - 3 H m_a A s = 0 \Rightarrow \frac{\dot{A}}{A} = - \frac{3}{2} H = - \frac{3}{2} \frac{\dot{a}}{a}.
\end{equation}
From this we can see directly that $A \sim a^{-3/2}$.

\subsection{Tracking Solutions}
The approximation in this section is concerned with potentials of exponential rather then harmonic types. These lead to so called tracking solutions.
The idea of tracking solutions was first proposed in the context of quintessence solutions for the dark energy problem in ref. \cite{tracking_solutions_Steinhardt:1999nw}.
Here we follow the derivation of \cite[appendix A]{Deformed_potential_Bae_2019} and \cite{tracking_solutions_Steinhardt:1999nw}.
A tracking solution is a attractor solution to the equation of motion of a scalar field which converges to a constant equation of state
\begin{equation}
	w_\phi = \frac{P}{\rho} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \dot{\phi}^2 - V(\phi)}{\frac{1}{2} \dot{\phi}^2 + V(\phi)}.
\end{equation}
Hence a tracking solution should also have a constant value of
\begin{equation}
	x = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \dot{\phi}^2}{V(\phi)} = \frac{1 + w_\phi}{1 - w_\phi}.
\end{equation}
We can write the e.o.m. as
\begin{align}
	\label{eq:tracking_eom}
	\frac{1}{6} \frac{\mathrm{d} \log x}{\mathrm{d} \log a}
	&= \frac{1}{6} \frac{1}{H} \frac{1}{x} \frac{\mathrm{d} x}{\mathrm{d} t}
	= \frac{1}{6 H} \frac{V}{\frac{1}{2} \dot{\phi}^2} \frac{\ddot{\phi} \dot{\phi} V(\phi) - \frac{1}{2} \dot{\phi}^2 \dot{\phi} V'(\phi)}{V^2(\phi)} \nonumber \\
	&= - \frac{V'}{V} \frac{1}{3 H} \left( \frac{V}{\dot{\phi}} + \frac{1}{2} \dot{\phi} \right) - 1
	= \frac{1}{3 H} \sqrt{ \frac{ \frac{1}{2} \dot{\phi}^2 + V(\phi) }{1 + w_\phi}} \nonumber \\
	&= \sqrt{ \frac{ M_\mathrm{pl} \frac{ \frac{1}{2} \dot{\phi}^2 + V(\phi) } {3 H^2 M_\mathrm{pl}^2} }{3(1 + w_\phi)}} \frac{V'}{V} - 1
	= M_\mathrm{pl} \sqrt{ \frac{\Omega_\phi}{3(1 + w_\phi)}} \frac{V'}{V} - 1.
\end{align}
The derivative on the left hand side is required to be approximately vanishing for tracking solutions. Therefore we find that we require
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:const_x}
	\frac{V'(\phi)}{V(\phi)} \approx \frac{1}{M_\mathrm{pl}} \sqrt{\frac{3(1 + w_\phi)}{\Omega_\phi}} = \frac{\dot{\phi}}{H} \frac{1}{3(1 + w_\phi)}
\end{equation}
for tracking solutions to exist.
In order for the field to maintain a tracking solution this condition needs to be invariant under time-evolution. Hence if one takes the derivative of the equation of motion (in the form of eq. \eqref{eq:tracking_eom}) with respect to the field $\phi$ while also assuming a constant $x$ (eq. \eqref{eq:const_x}) we obtain a necessary condition for a stable tracking solution:
\begin{align}
	&0 = M_\mathrm{pl}  (3(1 + w_\phi))^2 \left( \sqrt{\Omega_\phi} \frac{V'' V - (V')^2}{V^2} + \frac{V'}{V} \frac{H}{\dot{\phi}} \left( - \frac{3}{2} (w_\phi - w) \right) \sqrt{\Omega_\phi} \right) \nonumber \\
	&\frac{V'' V}{(V')^2} = 1 + \frac{V}{V'} \frac{H}{\dot{\phi}} \frac{3}{2} (w_\phi - w) \nonumber \\
	& \Gamma \equiv \frac{V'' V}{(V')^2} = 1 + \frac{w_\phi - w}{2(1 + w_\phi)}.
	\label{eq:tracking_condition}
\end{align}
Here $w$ is the equation of state of the dominating energy component of the universe (the background).
Note that the quantity $\Gamma$ is a property of the potential only.
If $\Gamma$ is constant or at least doesn't vary significantly over the field range, then the right hand side of eq. \eqref{eq:tracking_condition}  is constant and hence can we find a stable tracking solution.
From this we can find the equation of state of the tracking field in terms of $\Gamma$:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:tracking_equation_of_state}
	w_\phi \approx \frac{w - 2(\Lambda - 1)}{1 + 2(\Lambda - 1)}.
\end{equation}
Furthermore it is also necessary that the solution is stable under small perturbations of i.e. $w_\phi$, $w_\phi \to w'_\phi = w_\phi + \delta w_\phi$. However this requires quite a bit of algebra and we refer to ref. \cite{tracking_solutions_Steinhardt:1999nw}.

\section{ALP Realignment}
This model is the simplest possible, which is a generic scalar field with mass $m_a$. Its Lagrangian is given as:
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \partial_\mu \phi \right)^2 - \frac{1}{2} m_a^2 \phi^2.
	\label{eq:L_alp}
\end{equation}
The resulting equation of motion reads:
\begin{equation}
	\ddot{\phi} + 3 H \dot{\phi} + m_a^2 \phi = 0.
\end{equation}
We call this unspecific particle an axion-like-particle (ALP) and due to its dynamics the ALP realignment model.
The dynamics of this model are as follows:
First the field is frozen due to Hubble friction. For this one can use the approximation found in sec. \ref{sec:slow_roll_approximation}. One can even approximate it as $\phi = \phi_\mathrm{initial}$.
When the condition in \eqref{eq:slow_roll_condition} is saturated, the field begins to move and enters the fast-roll epoch. The condition \eqref{eq:slow_roll_condition} in this case reads
\begin{equation}
	c \frac{m_a^2}{H^2} \ll 1 \Rightarrow H_\mathrm{osc} \equiv \sqrt{c} m_a.
\end{equation}
Here $H_\mathrm{osc}$ denotes the Hubble parameter where the axion field enters the fast-roll epoch and starts to oscillate (hence the name).
This will be the main epoch for asymmetry production.
Then the field oscillates, which can described by the WKB approximation from section \ref{sec:wkb_approximation} as
\begin{equation}
	\phi(t) = \phi(t_0) a(t)^{-3/2} \cos(m_a t).
\end{equation}
An example numerical solution for the field evolution of this model together with annotations for the different epochs, can be found in fig. \ref{fig:alp_realignment_time_evolution}.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\label{fig:alp_realignment_time_evolution}
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../../transport_eq_in_time/plots/alp_realignment_field_evolution.pdf}
    \caption{Evolution of the axion field for standard misalignment of an ALP with the Lagrangian in eq. \eqref{eq:L_alp}. On the x-axis time is shown in units of the axion mass $m_a$ on a log-scale. On the y-axis the misalignment angle $\theta$ is shown. Different epochs of the evolution are annotated.}
\end{figure}
Since a coupling to standard model particles exits as this is required for baryogenesis, the ALP has a decay rate into SM particles. If we couple to a $SU(N)$ sphaleron, then the decay rate into SU(N) gauge bosons is given by \cite[eq. 15]{Kusenko_2015_Axion_Leptogenesis}:
\begin{equation}
	\Gamma_a = \frac{\alpha_N^2}{64\pi^2} \frac{m_a^3}{f_a^2},
\end{equation}
where $f_a$ is the axion decay constant.
We use $N = 2$ for coupling to the weak sphaleron and the $B-L$ current and $N = 3$ for coupling to the strong sphaleron with their standard model values.

As the mass of this model has to be quite large in order to start moving at the required temperatures, the decay rate is also quite large.
At the same time the axion might dominate the energy density due to is large mass. This means that we have to deal with entropy production by the decay of the axion.
For this we use a system of equations similar to the reheating equations for the inflaton field. The equations for the axion decay read:
\begin{align}
	&\dot{\rho}_a + 3 H \rho_a = - \Gamma_a \nonumber \\
	&\dot{\rho}_\mathrm{rad} + 4 H \rho_\mathrm{rad} = + \Gamma_a \nonumber \\
	&3 M_\mathrm{pl}^3 H^2 = \rho_a + \rho_\mathrm{rad},
\end{align}
where $\rho_a = \frac{1}{2} \dot{\phi} + \frac{1}{2} m_a^2 \phi^2$ is the axion energy density for this model and $\rho_\mathrm{rad}$ the radiation energy density.
This system of equations has to be solve, while computing the dilution factor as
\begin{align}
	d &\equiv \frac{\eta(t_\mathrm{after-decay})}{\eta(t_\mathrm{before-decay})} = \frac{n(t_\mathrm{after-decay}) / n_\gamma(t_\mathrm{after-decay})}{n(t_\mathrm{before-decay}) / n_\gamma(t_\mathrm{before-decay})} \nonumber \\
	&= \frac{a(t_\mathrm{after-decay})^{-3} / T^3(t_\mathrm{after-decay})}{a(t_\mathrm{before-decay})^{-3} / T^3(t_\mathrm{before-decay})} \nonumber \\
	&= \left( \frac{T(t_\mathrm{before-decay})}{T(t_\mathrm{after-decay})} \right)^3 a^{-3}(t_\mathrm{after-decay}),
\end{align}
where the scale-factor $a$ is computed by integrating $H = \dot{a} / a$ with an initial condition of $a(t_\mathrm{before-decay}) = 1$.
As all of these ALPs with the masses required for baryogenesis decay in the early universe, they do not contribute to the dark matter density.

\section{Clockwork Theory Axions and Deformed Potentials}
The clockwork model was introduced to solve the hierarchy problem in particle physics i.e. the question why the Higgs and Planck masses are so different. In this work, we will explore the possibility that axions arising from this clockwork theory (so called clockwork axions), could potentially explain both the baryon asymmmetry and dark matter as suggested in  \cite{Deformed_potential_Bae_2019}. First we will derive the equations of motion for the clockwork axion and then discuss the particularities of the dynamics of the cosmological clockwork axion evolution.

\subsection{Derivation}
This derivation is based on the model used in \cite{Deformed_potential_Bae_2019}. This work relied on \cite{general_cont_clockwork_Choi_2018} for its formalism and so do we.

We start from $U(1)^N$ symmetric theory. It is broken spontaneously at a scale $f$ and explicitly by a mass term with charges of the form $\delta_{ij} - q \delta_{i,j+1}$. Hence the low-energy Lagrangian reads
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L} = \frac{f^2}{2} \sum_i (\partial U_i)^2 - \frac{m^2 f^2}{2} \sum_{i = 0}^{N - 1} (U_j^\dagger U^q_{j + 1} + \mathrm{h.c.}).
\end{equation}
We can write it in term of Goldstone bosons $\theta_i$ with $U_i = e^{i \theta_i/ f}$:
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_i (\partial \theta_i)^2 - \frac{m^2}{2} \sum_i (\theta_i - q \theta_{i + 1})^2 + O(\theta^4).
\end{equation}
A natural next step for a theory with many fields like this is to take the continuum limit and replace the field index with a coordinate $y$ of an extra-dimension.
We compactify the extra-dimension on a $S^1 / \mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold. Here $S^1$ is the circle and $\mathbb{Z}_2 = \{+1, -1\}$. This compactification has two fixpoints at $y = 0$ and $y = \pi R$. We live on the $y = 0$ brane.
Taking the continuum limit of the mass term yields
\begin{equation}
	\sum_i (\theta_i(x) - q \theta_{i + 1}(x))^2 \to \int \mathrm{d} y (\partial_y \theta(x, y) - m \theta(x, y) ).
\end{equation}
As we are taking $\theta$ to be an angular field, we make the replacement $m \theta(x, y) \to m \sin \theta(x, y)$.
Hence the action reads:
\begin{equation}
	S = \int \mathrm{d}^4 x \mathrm{d} y \left[ (\partial_\mu \theta(x, y))^2 + (\partial_y \theta(x, y) - m \sin \theta(x, y))^2 \right].
\end{equation}
Now we will derive the low-energy four-dimensional theory for this action.
First we do a field redefinition
\begin{equation}
	\varphi = \tan ( \theta / 2 ).
\end{equation}
After computing the derivatives (same for derivatives with respect to $x^\mu$) in the new variable $\varphi$:
\begin{align}
	\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial y} &= \frac{1}{2} (\varphi^2 + 1) \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial y} \nonumber \\
	\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial y} &= 2 \frac{\frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial y}}{\varphi^2 + 1}
\end{align}
and using the identity
\begin{equation}
	\sin(2 \arctan(\varphi)) = \frac{2 \varphi}{\varphi^2 + 1}
\end{equation}
we find
\begin{align}
    S &= \int \mathrm{d}^4 x \mathrm{d} y \left[
    \left(2 \frac{\partial_\mu \varphi}{\varphi^2 + 1} \right)^2 +
    \left(2 \frac{\partial_y \varphi}{\varphi^2 + 1} + m \frac{2 \varphi}{\varphi^2 + 1} \right) \right] \nonumber \\
    &= \int \mathrm{d}^4 x \mathrm{d} y  \frac{4}{(\varphi^2 + 1)^2}
    \left[ (\partial_\mu \varphi)^2 + (\partial_y \varphi - m \varphi)^2 \right].
\end{align}
We see that if we choose
\begin{equation}
	\partial_y \varphi = m \varphi,
\end{equation}
then the mass-term in the action above vanishes and we obtain the action for a mass-less mode. Furthermore there is also no kinetic term for the $y$ coordinate anymore, hence the field is localized at $y = 0$.
We obtain
\begin{equation}
	\varphi_{\mathrm{massless}} = e^{my} \phi(x).
\end{equation}
Here $\phi(x)$ captures the remaining dependence on the coordinate $x$ of the solution for the massless mode.
Inserting this solution back into the action, allows us to solve the $y$ integral explicitly \footnote{We are dropping constant prefactors of the action within calculations.}:
\begin{align}
	S &= \int \mathrm{d}^4 x \mathrm{d} y  \frac{(\partial_\mu \varphi_{\mathrm{massless}})^2}{(\varphi_{\mathrm{massless}}^2 + 1)^2} \nonumber \\
	&= \int \mathrm{d}^4 x \mathrm{d} y  \frac{(\partial_\mu \phi)^2 e^{2my}}{(e^{2my} \phi^2 + 1)^2} \nonumber \\
	&= \int \mathrm{d}^4 x\frac{1}{(\phi^2 + 1)(\phi^2 e^{2\pi m R} + 1)}
\end{align}
Now we rewrite the action back in terms of $\theta(x) \equiv \theta(x, 0)$ using $\tan(\theta(x)/2) = \phi(x)$:
\begin{align}
	 S &= \int \mathrm{d}^4 x \frac{(\partial_\mu \tan(\theta / 2))^2}{(\tan^2(\theta / 2) + 1)(\tan^2(\theta / 2) e^{2\pi m R} + 1)} \nonumber \\
	 &= \int \mathrm{d}^4 x \frac{(\partial_\mu \theta)^2}{\cos^4(\theta/2)(\tan^2(\theta / 2) + 1)(\tan^2(\theta / 2) e^{2\pi m R} + 1)} \nonumber \\
	 &= \int \mathrm{d}^4 x \frac{(\partial_\mu \theta)^2}{(\sin^2(\theta / 2) + \cos^2(\theta/2))(\sin^2(\theta / 2) e^{2\pi m R} + \cos^2(\theta / 2))} \nonumber \\
	 &= \int \mathrm{d}^4 x \frac{(\partial_\mu \theta)^2}{\sin^2(\theta / 2) e^{2\pi m R} + \cos^2(\theta / 2)} \nonumber \\
	 &= \int \mathrm{d}^4 x \frac{(\partial_\mu \theta)^2}{(1 - \cos \theta) / 2 e^{2\pi m R} + (\cos \theta + 1) / 2} \nonumber \\
	 &= \int \mathrm{d}^4 x \frac{(\partial_\mu \theta)^2}{\cos(\theta)(1 - e^{2\pi mR}) + 1 + e^{2\pi mR}} \nonumber \\
	 &= \int \mathrm{d}^4 x \frac{(\partial_\mu \theta)^2}{\cos \theta + \frac{1 + e^{2\pi mR}}{1 - e^{2\pi mR}}} \nonumber \\
	 &= \int \mathrm{d}^4 x \frac{(\partial_\mu \theta)^2}{\cos(\theta) - \coth(\pi mR)}
\end{align}

The Lagrangian of this field $\theta(x)$ has the form
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L} = \frac{f^2}{2} Z(\theta) (\partial_\mu \theta)^2 - V(\theta),
\end{equation}
where $V(\theta)$ is a potential which we have omitted so far.
We call the function $Z(\theta) = 1 / (\cos(\theta) - \coth(\pi m R))$ in the kinetic term the wavefunction (as in renormalisation).
To understand the cosmological dynamics of this system, it is more convenient to deal with a canonical kinetic term. Therefore we will defined a canonical field $\phi(x)$. Note that this is a different field than the $\phi$ used before which was just an intermediate auxiliary variable.
The canonical field is given by
\begin{equation}
	\phi \equiv f \int_0^\theta \mathrm{d} \theta' \sqrt{Z(\theta')}
\end{equation}
such that the Lagrangian reads
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} (\partial \phi)^2 - V(\theta(\phi)).
\end{equation}
Note that now the potential is modified by the conversion from the $\phi$ to the $\theta$ field. To understand the dynamics late on, we have to analyze this `deformed' potential.
But first we compute $\phi$ explicitly:
\begin{align}
	\phi &= f \int_0^\theta \mathrm{d} \theta' \frac{1}{\sqrt{\coth(\pi mR) - \cos(\theta')}} \nonumber \\
	&= f \int_0^\theta \mathrm{d} \theta' \frac{1}{\sqrt{\coth(\pi mR) - 1 + \sin^2(\theta'/2)}} \nonumber \\
	&= \frac{2 f}{\sqrt{\coth(\pi mR) - 1}} \int_0^{\theta/2} \mathrm{d} z \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{\coth(\pi mR) - 1} \sin^2(z)}} \nonumber \\
	&= \frac{2 f}{\sqrt{\coth(\pi mR) - 1}} F\big(\theta / 2 \big| \frac{1}{\coth(\pi mR) - 1}\big),
\end{align}
where $F(x|y)$ is the incomplete Jacobi elliptic integral defined to be the solution to the last integral in this calculation.
At this point we approximate the $\coth$ to express our equations with an explicit small parameter
\begin{equation}
	\epsilon \equiv e^{-\pi m R},
\end{equation}
such that
\begin{equation}
	\coth(\pi m R) \approx 1 + 2 \epsilon^2 + O(\epsilon^4).
\end{equation}
Using this we find that:
\begin{equation}
	\phi = \frac{2 f}{\epsilon} F\big(\theta / 2 \big| - \epsilon^{-2} \big).
\end{equation}
Let us take the inverse of this equation to obtain $\theta(\phi)$, required to calculate the potential:
\begin{equation}
	\theta = 2 \operatorname{am}\left(\frac{\epsilon \phi}{2 f} | - \epsilon^{-2}\right),
\end{equation}
where $\operatorname{am}$ is the Jacobi elliptic amplitude define as the inverse of $F$ in the first argument.
Furthermore let us define a helper function $u(\phi)$:
\begin{equation}
	\tan(\theta / 2) = u(\phi),
\end{equation}
which is given explicitly by
\begin{equation}
	u(\theta) = \operatorname{sc}(\frac{\epsilon \phi}{2 f} | - \epsilon^{-2}),
\end{equation}
where $\operatorname{sc}$ is the Jacobi elliptic function defined as the tangent of $\operatorname{am}$.
Now we can compute the potential for $\phi$:
\begin{align}
	V(\phi) &= V(\theta(\phi)) = \Lambda^4 (1 - \cos (\theta(\phi)))
	= \Lambda^4 ( 1 - \cos (2 \operatorname{am} ( \frac{\epsilon \phi}{2 f} | - \epsilon^{-2}) )) \nonumber \\
	&= \Lambda^4 ( 1 - (1 - 2 \sin^2( \operatorname{am}(\frac{\epsilon \phi}{2 f} | - \epsilon^{-2})))) \nonumber \\
	&= 2 \Lambda^4 \operatorname{sn}^2 ( \frac{\epsilon \phi}{2 f} | - \epsilon^{-2} ) \nonumber \\
	&= \frac{2 \Lambda^4}{1 + \frac{1}{u^2(\phi)}}.
\end{align}
In the last line we have used that $\sin^2(x) = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{1}{\tan^2(x)}}$. The function $\operatorname{sn}$ is the sine of $\operatorname{am}$.
We also go through the algebra of computing the first and second derivative of the potential for $\phi$ but skip intermediate steps:
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial V}{\partial \phi} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{Z}} \frac{\Lambda^4}{f} \frac{\partial U}{\partial \theta}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial \phi^2} = \frac{\Lambda^4}{f^2} \frac{1}{Z} \left( \frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial \theta^2} - \frac{1}{2 Z} \frac{\partial Z}{\partial \theta} \frac{\partial U}{\partial \theta} \right)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	M \equiv \frac{\Lambda^2}{f}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial V}{\partial \phi} = 4 \frac{\Lambda^4}{f^2} \frac{\frac{\partial u}{\partial \phi} f}{u^3(1 + 1/u^2)^2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial u}{\partial \phi} = \epsilon \frac{1}{2 f} \frac{\operatorname{dn}[\phi/2f|1 - \varepsilon^2]}{(\operatorname{cn}[\phi/2f|1 - \varepsilon^2])^2}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\dot{\theta} = \frac{\frac{1}{2M^2} \left| \frac{\partial V}{\partial \phi} \right| \dot{\phi} / f}{\left(\left(1 - \frac{V/f^2}{2M^2}\right) \frac{V / f^2}{2 M^2} \right)^{1/2}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial \phi^2} = 4 M^2 \left[ f^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial \phi^2} \frac{1}{u^3(1 + 1/u^2)^2} + f^2 \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial \phi} \right)^2 \frac{4(1 + 1/u^2) - 3u^2(1 + 1/u^2)^2}{\left( u^3(1 + 1/u^2)^2 \right)^2} \right]
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial \phi^2} = \frac{\varepsilon}{4 f^2} \left[ 2 \operatorname{cn}(\phi/2f|1 - \varepsilon^2)^{-3} \operatorname{dn}(\phi/2f|1 - \varepsilon^2)^2 - (1 - \varepsilon^2) \operatorname{cn}(\phi/2f|1 - \varepsilon^2)^{-1} \right] \operatorname{sn}(\phi/2f|1 - \varepsilon^2)
\end{equation}
Here we have used $\operatorname{cn}$ which is the cosine of $\operatorname{am}$ and $\operatorname{dn}$ which is $\partial_u \operatorname{am}(u, s)$.
The resulting potential $V(\phi)$ is plotted in figure \ref{fig:clockwork_pot_plot}. As one can see, potentials with hight values of $mR$ i.e. lower $\epsilon$ are deformed stronger as they are very steep for lager field values and flattened towards zero.
This will strongly impact the dynamics of the field, as will discussed in the next section.
Last but not least we obtain the periodicity of the potential for the canonical field $\phi$ from analysing the special functions involved \cite[eq. 3.69, 3.70]{general_cont_clockwork_Choi_2018}:
\begin{equation}
    f_\mathrm{eff} \equiv \frac{2 f}{\pi} K(1 - \epsilon^2),
\end{equation}
such that $V(\phi)$ has a periodicity of $2 \pi f_\mathrm{eff}$.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Dynamics}
Now we are ready to discuss the dynamics of the clockwork axion.
We follow the discussion of \cite{Deformed_potential_Bae_2019} but restrict ourselves to the case applicable to the clockwork axion.
To do this, we will approximate the wavefunction $Z(\theta)$ such that it is easier to handle. We will do this in different field ranges corresponding to different epoch of the field time-evolution.
We consider a potential for $\theta$ given by
\begin{equation}
	V(\theta) = \Lambda^4(1 - \cos \theta).
\end{equation}
This potential is a generic potential generated by non-perturbative instanton effects.

First we start with an initial field value of $\phi(t_i) = \phi_i = \mathcal{O}(1)$.
In this regime we find that
\begin{equation}
	Z(\theta) \approx \frac{1}{1 + 2\epsilon^2 - (-1)} \sim \mathcal{O}(1)
\end{equation}
and hence
\begin{equation}
	\phi(\theta) = f \theta.
\end{equation}
This gives a harmonic potential:
\begin{equation}
	V(\theta) \approx \Lambda^4\left(1 - \frac{\theta^2}{2}\right) \approx \Lambda^4\left(1 - \frac{1}{f^2} \frac{\phi^2}{2}\right).
\end{equation}
In this early period the Hubble parameter is sufficiently large such that the slow-roll condition (eq. \eqref{eq:slow_roll_condition}) is fulfilled
\begin{equation}
	H \gg \frac{\Lambda^2}{f}.
\end{equation}
The dynamics in this epoch is described by the slow-roll equation (see eq. \eqref{eq:slow_roll_approx_eom}):
\begin{equation}
	\dot{\phi} \approx - \frac{1}{c H} \frac{\Lambda^4}{f^2} \phi.
\end{equation}
Once the Hubble parameter saturates the slow-roll condition
\begin{equation}
	H \approx \frac{1}{\sqrt{c}} \frac{\Lambda^2}{f},
\end{equation}
the field enters the fast-roll period.
Here we find that the field reaches a time derivative of
\begin{equation}
	\dot{\phi} \approx - \frac{1}{c} \sqrt{c} \frac{f}{\Lambda^2} \phi \frac{\Lambda^4}{f^2} \approx - \frac{\Lambda^2}{\sqrt{c}}.
\end{equation}
As this is the larges time derivative reached over the field-evolution, this is where the source for SBG the largest.
Hence it is important that this happens at sufficiently high temperatures i.e. that $\Lambda^2/f$ is only slightly lower than the Hubble parameter after inflation $H_\mathrm{inf}$.

Once the field value of $\theta$ falls below $\mathcal{O}(1)$ values, the deformation of the potential kicks in.
For $\epsilon \lesssim |\theta| \lesssim \mathcal{O}(1)$ we find that
\begin{equation}
	Z(\theta) \approx \frac{1}{1 + 2\epsilon^2 + 1 - \theta^2/2} \sim \theta^{-2}.
\end{equation}
and hence
\begin{equation}
	\phi(\theta) = f \int_0^\epsilon \mathrm{d} \theta' \sqrt{\epsilon^{-2}} + f \int_\epsilon^\theta \mathrm{d} \theta' \sqrt{ (\theta')^{-2}} = f \frac{1}{\epsilon} \epsilon + f \log \theta - f \log \epsilon = f \left(1 - \log \frac{\theta}{\epsilon}\right).
\end{equation}
This gives us an exponential potential:
\begin{equation}
	\phi(\theta) \approx \frac{\Lambda^4}{2} \theta^2 \approx \frac{\Lambda^4}{2} \epsilon^2 \exp \left[ 2 ( | \phi | / f - 1 ) \right].
\end{equation}
Such a potential fulfills the conditions for a tracking potential \eqref{eq:tracking_condition} as
\begin{equation}
	\Gamma = \frac{V'' V}{(V')} = \frac{(2/f)^2 \exp(2(|\phi| / f - 1)) \exp(2(|\phi| / f - 1))}{(2/f \exp(2(|\phi| / f - 1)))^2} = 1 = \mathrm{const}
\end{equation}
holds.
In this epoch we find from eq. \eqref{eq:tracking_equation_of_state} that the equation of state of the clockwork axion field is
\begin{equation}
	w_\phi = w.
\end{equation}
Hence the energy density of the field tracks the dominant energy density i.e. radiation.
Also this means that the density parameter will be approximately constant as both the energy density of the axion field and the critical density evolve with the same power-law.

The clockwork axion field will stay on the tracking attractor as long as its potential has the exponential form.
Once $\theta \lesssim \epsilon$ however, the wavefunction $Z$ has the form
\begin{equation}
	Z(\theta) \approx \frac{1}{1 + 2\epsilon^2 - 1 + \theta^2/2} \sim \epsilon^{-2}.
\end{equation}
and hence
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:small_field_value_relation}
	\phi(\theta) = f \epsilon^{-2} \theta.
\end{equation}
This yields a harmomic potential which does not support the tracking solution:
\begin{equation}
	V(\theta) \approx \Lambda^4 \frac{1}{2} \theta^2 \approx \frac{\epsilon^2 \Lambda^4}{2 f^2} \phi^2.
\end{equation}
If at this point the slow-roll condition is fulfilled then the field will be frozen again and starts to oscillate later otherwise it will start to oscillate immediately.
The mass of the canonical field $\phi$ in this epoch is suppressed by the small parameter $\epsilon$. Therefore this happens at later times and the relic density is not suppressed.
Furthermore this factor also appears in the coupling of the canonical field to standard model particles and suppresses the decay rate even more (in addition to the suppression by the small mass). This makes the clockwork axion a stable particle and a valid dark matter candidate.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\label{fig:evolution_of_clockwork_axion_field}
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../../transport_eq_in_time/plots/cw_field_evolution.pdf}
	\caption{Plot of the evolution of the clockwork axion field as a function of time on the x-axis in units for the inverse mass scale $1/M$ on a log-scale. The canonical field is shown on the y-axis in units of the decay constant $f$. The different epochs of the field evolution described in the main text are annotated and the final epoch of oscillations are shown as an inset plot.}
\end{figure}

Let us summaries the findings of this section.
First the clockwork axion is frozen by Hubble friction. At $\theta = O(1)$ field values, the mass of the field is quite hight and fast-roll begins at $H = \Lambda^2 / f$. In this epoch the temperatures are high enough such that the clockwork axion field sources spontaneous baryogenesis.
It then enters a regime of the potential that is approximately exponential.
Here it follows a tracking attractor and the relic density is conserved.
Finally the potential is harmonic again at low field values and tracking stops.
Here the mass it suppressed and the particle stable.
The field starts to oscillate and behaves like matter. Hence it is a dark matter component. A numerical simulation of the full equation of motion and the different epochs is shown in fig. \ref{fig:evolution_of_clockwork_axion_field}. A plot of the potential with the different epochs is shown in \ref{fig:clockwork_potential_parts}.

\section{Multi Axion Systems}
A particularly interesting model would both generate the baryon asymmetry and the dark matter density of the universe while explaining why they are of the same order of magnitude.
Also it is interesting to implement a model which has axions of lower mass without also reducing the axion-photon coupling.
We tried to implement such a model using two coupled fields.
A first attempt is a quartic coupling between them of the form:
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:multi_axion_quatic}
	\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} (\partial \phi_1)^2 + \frac{1}{2} (\partial \phi_2)^2 - \frac{1}{2} m_1^2 \phi_1^2 - \frac{1}{2} m_2^2 \phi_2^2 - g \phi_1^2 \phi_2^2.
\end{equation}
An example evolution of the two fields is shown in fig. \ref{fig:multi_axion_quatic_evolution_example}.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../../experiments/example_field_evolution_quatic_coupling.pdf}
	\caption{An example evolution of the multi axion system as defined in eq. \eqref{eq:multi_axion_quatic}.
	The parameters are dimensionless combinations of the physical ones: $M = m_2^2 / m_1^2$ and $G = g \Lambda^2 / m_1^2$ where $\phi_\mathrm{phys} = \Lambda \phi$. Their values are given in the title.
	The top plot shows the time-evolution of the two fields, with the Hubble parameter on the log-scale x-axis.
	The bottom plot shows the same evolution in configuration space, which the potential plotted in log-values in the background.
	}
	\label{fig:multi_axion_quatic_evolution_example}
\end{figure}
Here the effective mass of the fields are given by
\begin{align}
	\label{eq:multi_axion_H_osc}
	m_1^\mathrm{eff} &= \sqrt{m_1^2 + 2 g \phi_2^2} \nonumber \\
	m_2^\mathrm{eff} &= \sqrt{m_2^2 + 2 g \phi_1^2}.
\end{align}
Hence even if the bare masses $m_1$ and/or $m_2$ are less than the Hubble scale $H$ at time $t$, the field might already oscillate due to the extra term from the other field. If we assume that the quatic coupling $g$ is of order unity, then the mass in this limit is given by the scale of the other field.
More concretely if we decompose $\phi_k = f_k \theta_k$ where $\theta_k = \mathcal{O}(1)$ at $t = t_i$, then
the decay constants give the start of oscillations
$3 H_\mathrm{osc} = \max(m_1^\mathrm{eff}, m_2^\mathrm{eff}) \approx \max(f_1, f_2)$.
We tested this numerically. The results are shown in fig. \ref{fig:multi_axion_quatic_H_osc}
\begin{figure}[H]
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../../experiments/H_osc_plots.pdf}
	\caption{The numerically computed $H_osc$ for a multi axion system as defined in eq. \eqref{eq:multi_axion_quatic}. Each subplot is for different rations of the initial conditions for the two fields. Each subplot contains three colors of curves corresponding to different redefined dimensionless mass parameters $M$. The solid curves are the numerical results and the dashed ones are the theory prediction from eq. \eqref{eq:multi_axion_H_osc} (without the approximation). The x-axis is the redefined coupling $G$ and the y-axis the Hubble parameter $H_\mathrm{osc}$ where oscillations start.}
	\label{fig:multi_axion_quatic_H_osc}
\end{figure}

This means that in such a model we can generate a field velocity and source baryogenesis, even at lower particle masses. Lets couple the field $\phi_1$ to the standard model.
It hence sources baryogenesis. Due to the coupling it also decays into standard model particles at $t_1^\mathrm{decay}$.
The other field $\phi_2$ then will not get a contribution to its effective mass from the condensate of the field $\phi_1$ anymore. Hence
\begin{equation}
	m_2^\mathrm{eff} = m_2 \, \mathrm{for} \, t > t_1^\mathrm{decay}.
\end{equation}
If at $t_1^\mathrm{decay}$ we find $3 H(t_1^\mathrm{decay}) > m_2$, then the field of $\phi_2$ will be frozen again.
Hence the relic density of the field $\phi_1$ from realignment once the it starts to oscillate again.

Due to the non-linearity and the higher dimension of the phase-space \footnote{Chaotic behavior is only possible in dynamical systems of at least dimension $3$. Technically even one scalar field fulfills this requirement as the explicit time-dependence or equivalently the Friedmann equation gives a third dimension additionally to $\phi$ and $\dot{\phi}$, but this coordinate only changes slowly compared to the other ones and hence no chaotic behavior can be expected in the case of one scalar field. This only changes once we introduce multiple fields.}, we find that the dynamics of the two fields is non-trivial and exhibits chaotic behavior. This is evident from the fact that parts from the parameter space exhibit a positive largest Lyapunov exponents \footnote{The sum of Lyapunov exponents is almost zero in our result. As this is almost a Hamiltonian system (apart from the Hubble friction, which is low in this regime) the sum of Lyapunov exponents should be almost zero.}. This is shown in fig. \ref{fig:multi_axions_lyapunov}. For a definition and explanation of Lyapunov exponents see ref. \cite{nonlinear_dynamics}. The scaling of the energy density is also not clear. However it seems that in parts of the parameter space the scaling is radiation like and in parts matter like.

Unfortunately this is very hard to simulate numerically as one needs to propagate the fields to the decay of field $\phi_1$. This takes a long time as the decay rate is very low due to the scaling
\begin{equation}
	\Gamma \sim \frac{m_1^3}{f_1^2}.
\end{equation}
In this time-frame a lot of oscillations need to the integrated, making this simulation unfeasible.

The problem with the quatic coupling is that it is not (discretely) shift-symmetric and hence can not be a valid coupling for an axion.
Multi axion system have been discussed in the context of inflation in ref. \cite{Kim_multi_axions:2004rp}.
A potential for a system of axion would be given as
\begin{equation}
	\mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_i \left( \partial_\mu \phi_i \right)^2 - \sum_i \Lambda_i^4 \left[ 1 - \cos \left( \sum_j Q_{i,j} \, \frac{\phi_j}{f_j} \right) \right]
\end{equation}
Sadly this model doesn't posses the properties of the model discussed above.
This can be seen from the taylor expandsion of the potential:
\begin{equation}
	- \frac{\Lambda_{0}^{4} Q_{00}^{2} Q_{01}^{2} + \Lambda_{1}^{4} Q_{10}^{2} Q_{11}^{2} }{4 f_{0}^{2} f_{1}^{2}} \phi_{0}^{2} \phi_{1}^{2}
	+ \frac{\Lambda_{0}^{4} Q_{00}^{2}
	+ \Lambda_{1}^{4} Q_{10}^{2} }{2 f_{0}^{2}} \phi_{0}^{2}
	+ \frac{\Lambda_{0}^{4} Q_{01}^{2}
	+ \Lambda_{1}^{4} Q_{11}^{2}}{2 f_{1}^{2}} \phi_{1}^{2}
	+ \frac{\Lambda_{0}^{4} Q_{00} Q_{01} + \Lambda_{1}^{4} Q_{10} Q_{11} }{f_{0} f_{1}} \phi_{0} \phi_{1}
\end{equation}
The quatic term is negtive, hence it is dominated by the other terms and it can't function as a generator for a higher effective mass.
Therefore for this model, one could only take one axion with a large mass which sources baryogenesis and one light field which creates the dark matter density.


\chapter{Implementation of the Numerical Simulations}
\label{sec:implementation_of_the_numerical_simulations}
In this section we will briefly look at the program which was written for this thesis project in order to compute the baryon asymmetry.

\section{Used Equations}
Let us start by summarizing the dynamical equation used.
First the background the covered by the equations for reheating namely the continuity equation for the inflaton field (eq. \eqref{eq:cont_eq_inf}) and for the radiation bath (eq. \eqref{eq:cont_eq_rad}) as well as the Friedmann (eq. \eqref{eq:friedmann_equation}):
\begin{align}
	&\dot{\rho}_\mathrm{inf} + 3 H \rho_\mathrm{inf} = - \Gamma_\mathrm{inf} \nonumber \\
	&\dot{\rho}_\mathrm{rad} + 4 H \rho_\mathrm{rad} = + \Gamma_\mathrm{inf} \nonumber \\
	& 3 M_\mathrm{pl}^2 H^2 = \rho_\mathrm{inf} + \rho_\mathrm{rad}
\end{align}
Second the motion of the axion field is described by the Klein-Gordon equation on an FLRW background (eq. \eqref{eq:scalar_field_eom})
\begin{equation}
	\ddot{\phi_i} + 3 H \dot{\phi_i} + V'(\{\phi\}) = 0.
\end{equation}
Finally the evolution of the standard model charges is given by the transport equation (eq. \eqref{eq:transport_equation})
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d} t} \left( \frac{\mu_i}{T} \right) = - \frac{1}{g_i} \sum_\alpha n^\alpha_i \frac{\Gamma_\alpha}{T^3 / 6} \left[ \sum_j n_j^\alpha \left( \frac{\mu_j}{T} \right) + n_S^\alpha \frac{\dot{a}}{f_a T} \right] - 3 \left( \frac{\mu_i}{T} \right) \left[ \frac{\dot{T}}{T} + H \right].
\end{equation}
Here we use the charges and interaction given in sec. \ref{sec:charges_and_rates_in_the_standard_model}.

In order to solve these equation on a computer it is useful to de-dimensionalize them.
This makes the numerical integration more stable as the variables involved are not too big or small and can more accurately be represented by floating point number avoiding round-off errors.
We choose $t_\mathrm{RH}$ as the time unit for the background, $1 / m_a$ as the time unit for the axion and $1 / \Gamma_\mathrm{inf}$ for the transport equation.
Furthermore we use $\rho_{\mathrm{inf}, \mathrm{rad}} / \rho_{\mathrm{inf}, \mathrm{rad}}(t_\mathrm{RH})$ to integrate the background, $a / f_a$ to integrate the axion and $(\mu_i / T) / (\mu_i^\mathrm{equilibrium} / T)$ to integrate the standard model charges.

\section{Program Structure}
The program is structured as follows.
We solve the equations from the previous section one after the other as there are to a good approximation on backreactions to the previous one (e.g. there is no backreaction of the axion to the background cosmology).
This allows the numerical solvers to take time-steps appropriate to the equation, not being forced to take the smallest required time-steps for all equations.
For this we utilize the feature of continuous output from ODE solvers. The solver returns a callable object, which behaves as the function which solves the given ODE. The solver has more information than just a time-series of solution, as it also knows about the derivatives from the ODE.

Furthermore is program is written such a way that one can implement new axion models and couplings as classes.
However the charges simulated and the background cosmology are hard-coded.

\section{Numerical Methods}
The this system of equations is implemented in the python programming language using the numpy, scipy and matplotlib libraries.
The following solvers from the solve\_ivp function from scipy.integrate are used for the different equations:
\begin{table}[H]
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{lll}
			Equation & Solver & Tolerances \\
			\hline
			 Background & RK45 & $\mathrm{rtol} = 10^{-6}$ \\
			 Axion & Radau & $\mathrm{rtol} = 10^{-10}$ \\
			 Transport Eq. & BDF & $\mathrm{rtol} = 10^{-10}$ \\
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
\end{table}
These solvers were selected by try and error regarding performance and stability. Note that the axion and the transport eq. exhibit stiff behavior, hence the choice of implicit methods while the background equations behave as power-laws for the different parts of the background evolution hence a (faster) explicit method is sufficient.

\section{Convergence Checks}
We start by solving all equations up until the time where $T \sim 10^{12} \, \mathrm{GeV}$.
Then we check how large the relative change in the $B - L$ charge over this interval is. If its below $10^{-3}$  we stop the iteration. Otherwise we proceed to integrate about 10 units of time in axion units. This allows us to obtain results within at least 3 digits of significance as is required to be compared to the observed value.

The same kind of procedure is applied to the relic density for the clockwork axion and the dilution factor for the generic ALP model.

\chapter{Results}
\label{sec:results}
In this chapter we finally present our results for the asymmetry computation in turn for the generic ALP realignment model and the clockwork model.
Each section considers different couplings and the possible parameter-space of the model.

\section{ALP Realignment}
The generic ALP realignment model has the following parameters:
\begin{table}[H]
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{ll}
			Name & Symbol \\
			\hline
			Hubble parameter at the end of inflation & $H_\mathrm{inf}$ \\
			Inflaton decay rate  & $\Gamma_\mathrm{inf}$ \\
			Axion mass & $m_a$ \\
			Axion decay constant & $f_a$ \\
			Initial misalignment angle & $\theta_i$ \\
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
\end{table}
We fix the Hubble parameter at the end of inflation to the value of $H_\mathrm{inf} = 2.51 \times 10^{12} \, \mathrm{GeV}$ and the initial misalignment angle to $\theta_i = 1$ for simplicity.
The inflaton decay rate $\Gamma_\mathrm{inf}$ has to be less than the Hubble parameter at the end of inflation $H_\mathrm{inf}$ as the inflaton is only allowed to start to decay after the end of inflation. Otherwise the model is inconsistent. Also the axion mass has to be less than the Hubble parameter at the end of inflation $H_\mathrm{inf}$ because otherwise the axion would start to oscillate before the end of inflation. While this would be possible in principle, we can't simply set the initial condition to the $\dot{\theta} = 0$ and $\theta = \theta_i = 1$ at the end of inflation here. Hence we exclude this case.
Finally we also fix the axion decay constant to $f_a = 10^{13} \, \mathrm{GeV}$ for now.
The resulting asymmetry is shown in fig. \ref{fig:alp_paramspace}. The correct asymmetry is indicated by a red line. Here we see already that a large part of the parameter space allows for successful baryogenesis for all couplings, including the coupling to the strong sphaleron which is not directly connected to the $B - L$ charge.
In each of the three couplings considered increasing the inflaton decay rate $\Gamma_\mathrm{inf}$ and the axion mass $m_a$ at the same time also increases the resulting baryon asymmetry. This is because high inflaton decay rates lead to higher temperatures and hence higher production rates. One has to increase the axion mass at the same time to ensure that the peak of the axion derivative $\dot{\theta}$ (which sources the asymmetry production) aligns with the high temperature phase as this phase happens earlier as the inflaton decay rate is increased. One can also see that at sufficiently high inflaton decay rates and low axion masses, the asymmetry becomes independent of the inflaton decay rate. This is because in this part of the parameter space, the asymmetry production happens after the decay of the inflaton in the radiation dominated era. Here the Hubble parameter is given by the temperature and hence also the time when the axion enters fast-roll. Therefore the asymmetry is independent of the inflaton decay rate.
The processes of asymmetry production are shown in figs. \ref{fig:alp_explorations_plot_aFF},  \ref{fig:alp_explorations_plot_aJ} and \ref{fig:alp_explorations_plot_aGG}.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../../transport_eq_in_time/plots/alp_paramspace.pdf}
    \caption{Contour plots of the obtained baryon asymmetry  for the ALP model (shown as the decimal logarithm relative to the observed asymmetry) for the different couplings ($a\tilde{F}F$ on the left, $a\partial J$ in the middle and $a \tilde{G} G$ on the right) as a function of the axion mass $m_a$ in GeV on the x-axis on a log-scale and of the inflaton decay rate in GeV on the y-axis on a log-scale (shown on the left-most plot on the left-hand-side). The reheating temperature $T_\mathrm{RH}$ corresponding to the inflaton decay rate is shown on the right most plot on the right hand side in GeV also on a log-scale. A red line indicates the points where the observed asymmetry is reached. The values of the axion decay constant $f_a$ and Hubble scale a the end of inflation $H_\mathrm{inf}$ are given in the title. All contour plots share the same colorbar, shown below the plots.}
    \label{fig:alp_paramspace}
\end{figure}
Notice that in the model, the axion decay constant only appears in the dilution factor from the axion decay.
This is because in this model the equation of motion for the axion is linear and hence the decay constant factors out. In the decay of the axion, the decay constant appears in the decay rate into SU(2) bosons.
Because of the structure of the parameter space, higher dilution factors i.e. higher values of the axion decay constant $f_a$ push the curve of successful baryogensis to higher values of the axion mass $m_a$ and the inflaton decay rate $\Gamma_\mathrm{inf}$. This is shown in fig. \ref{fig:apl_correct_f_a_curves}.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../../transport_eq_in_time/plots/alp_correct_f_a_curves.pdf}
	\caption{The curves where the observed baryon asymmetry is reached for the ALP model for different values of the axion decay constant $f_a$ for the different couplings ($a \tilde{F} F$ on the left, $a \partial J$ in the middle and $a \tilde{G} G$ on the right). The curves are shown in the inflaton decay rate $\Gamma_\mathrm{inf}$ (shown on the y-axis on a log-scale in GeV on the left-most plot) and axion mass $m_a$ (shown on the x-axis on a log-scale in GeV). Also the reheating temperature $T_{\mathrm{RH}}$ in GeV on a log-scale corresponding to the inflaton decay rate is shown on the right-most plot.
		Each curve is colored corresponding to the value of the axion decay rate used on a log-scale. The colorbar showing the corresponding $f_a$ value is displayed on the bottom.}
	\label{fig:apl_correct_f_a_curves}
\end{figure}
At a certain sufficiently low value of the axion decay constant $f_a$, the entropy dilution from the axion decay becomes inefficient i.e. the dilution factors becomes one.
Therefore at this value, the curve of successful baryogensis is at the lowest possible point in the $m_a, \Gamma_\mathrm{inf}$ plane. From this we obtain lower bounds on the axion mass $m_a$ and the inflaton decay rate $\Gamma_\mathrm{inf}$ for baryogenesis as
\begin{table}[H]
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{l|lll}
			& $a F \tilde{F}$ & $a \partial J$ & $a G \tilde{G}$ \\

\section{Clockwork Theory Axions}
The clockwork axion model has the following parameters:
\begin{table}[H]
	\begin{center}
		\begin{tabular}{ll}
			Name & Symbol \\
			\hline
			Hubble parameter at the end of inflation & $H_\mathrm{inf}$ \\
			Inflaton decay rate  & $\Gamma_\mathrm{inf}$ \\
			Axion decay constant & $f$ where $f_\mathrm{eff} = \frac{2 f}{\pi} K(1 - \epsilon^2)$ \\
			Size of the extra dimension & $mR$ where $\epsilon = e^{\pi m R}$ \\
			Axion mass & $m_\phi = \epsilon M$ where $M = \frac{\Lambda^2}{f}$ \\
			Initial misalignment angle & $\theta_i$ \\
		\end{tabular}
	\end{center}
\end{table}
As in the generic ALP realignment model, we set Hubble parameter at the end of inflation to the value of $H_\mathrm{inf} = 2.51 \times 10^{12} \, \mathrm{GeV}$ and the initial misalignment angle to $\theta_i = 1$ fixed for simplicity.
First let us plot the parameter space of the clockwork axion mass $m_\phi$ vs the size of the extra dimension.
We exclude the region where the axion would start to oscillate before the end of inflation because of the initial condition issue.
Furthermore we exclude the region where the axion decays within the life time of the universe. Because the axion is still relatively light in this region, the decay happens quite late and is hence excluded.
In addition to the baryon asymmetry, we are also interested in the dark matter relic density of the axion.
Hence in this 2D parameter subspace, the correct parameters (successful baryogenesis and the relic density matches the dark matter density) are isolated points.
These parameter subspaces are shown for the different couplings in fig. \ref{fig:clockwork_parameter_space_aFF}, \ref{fig:clockwork_parameter_space_aJ} and \ref{fig:clockwork_parameter_space_aGG} for different values of the inflaton decay rate $\Gamma_\mathrm{inf} = 10^6 \, \mathrm{GeV}, \,
 10^8 \, \mathrm{GeV}, \, 10^{10} \, \mathrm{GeV}$ and the effective decay constant $f_\mathrm{eff} =  10^{12} \, \mathrm{GeV}, \,
 10^{13} \, \mathrm{GeV}, \, 10^{14} \, \mathrm{GeV}$.
One can see that the asymmetry produced is proportional to
\begin{equation}
	Y_B \sim \frac{m_\phi}{e^{- \pi m R}} = \frac{\Lambda^2}{f}.
\end{equation}
This is the effective mass of the canonical $\phi$ field and hence determines the time when the field enters the fast-roll epoch. If this happens earlier, then it also happens at higher temperature and a larger asymmetry is produced.
Example processes are shown in fig. \ref{fig:clockwork_parameter_space_exploration}.
\begin{figure}[H]
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../../transport_eq_in_time/plots/cw_exploration_plot.pdf}
	\caption{A contour plot of the clockwork axion mass $m_\phi$ vs size of the extra dimension $mR$ parameter-space is shown in the middle row. The baryon asymmetry is shown in green-blueish contour lines. The relic density is shown in red-yellowish contour lines. Both are shown are the decimal logarithm relative to the observed value. The red colored area indicates the part of the parameter-space where axion oscillates before the end of inflation and hence invalidates the model. The orange area indicates the that the axion decays within the life-time of the universe. In the top and bottom rows the time evolution of the processes corresponding to example points in the parameter space indicated by arrows is shown. Each of these plots consists of three subplots. On the left the evolution of the canonical clockwork field until the oscillations is shown. On the right the time evolution of the chemical potential over the temperature and the rate of B-L generation and the axion source as in fig. \ref{fig:alp_explorations_plot_aFF} are shown.}

Each contour plot has $mR$ on the y-axis on a linear scale shown on the left most plot of each row and $m_\phi$ in eV on the x-axis on a log-scale shown on the bottom plot of each column.

The intersection of both lines is shown as a red dot. Below the plots the colorbars for the baryon asymmetry and the relic density contour lines are shown.

    \label{fig:clockwork_parameter_space_aGG}
\end{figure}
We also investigate the parameter space of the axion mass $m_\phi$ vs the inflaton decay rate $\Gamma_\mathrm{inf}$
for different values of the size of the extra dimension $mR$ and couplings.The result is shown in fig. \ref{fig:cw_m_phi_vs_Gamma_inf}.
One can see that the parameter space has a similar structure that the one found in the generic ALP realignment model.
We exclude the region, where the axion would move before the end of inflation.
The artifacts seen in particular in the plot of $mR = 8$ and the $a \partial J_L$ coupling, stem from the extremely low values ($Y / Y^\mathrm{obs} \sim 10^{-12}$) of asymmetry produced, where numerical errors start to matter.
\begin{figure}[H]
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{../../transport_eq_in_time/plots/cw_m_phi_vs_Gamma_inf.pdf}
    \caption{The clockwork axion parameter space contour plots of the baryon asymmetry as the decimal logarithm relative to the observed baryon asymmetry as a function the inflaton decay rate $Gamma_\mathrm{inf}$ in GeV on the y-axis on a log-scale and the axion mass $m_\phi$ in eV on the x-axis on a log-scale.
    Each row has a different coupling namely $a F \tilde{F}$ in the top row, $a \partial J$ in the middle row and $a G \tilde{G}$ in the bottom row. Each column has a different value of the size of the extra dimension $mR$ indicated on the x-label of the bottom plot of each column. Each plot has its own colorbar for the contour lines as the scales are very different for each plot. A red line is used to indicate the curves where the observed baryon asymmetry is reached.}
	\label{fig:cw_m_phi_vs_Gamma_inf}
\end{figure}
In all these parameter scans, we see that one can generate the baryon asymmetry of the universe and the full dark matter using this model, in a range of about $10^{-4} \, \mathrm{eV}$ to $10^{6} \, \mathrm{eV}$. The size of the extra dimension is sbout $mR = 6$ to $mR = 14$. The range of required inflaton decay constants is about the Hubble parameter at the end of inflation to about $10^{-5}$ of the Hubble parameter at the end of inflation.
This shows that this model is viable for different couplings and a wide parameter range.


\chapter{Conclusion}

\section{Summery}
In this thesis we have investigated a model of spontaneous baryogenesis.
We have implemented it using axion models during reheating generating a $B - L$ charge, which is converted to B and L charges by standard model sphalerons.
We obtained results for two models. First the generic axion like particle model, which generates the necessary velocity by realignment.
Here the energy scale required is given by the mass. Due to the coupling and high mass, the axion decays into standard model particles.
This introduces a dilution of the asymmetry, which allows us to find lower bounds to the mass and the inflaton decay constant.
The other model is the clockwork axion model.
Here also the fast-roll epoch generates the necessary velocity. However it is followed by a tracking episode, which conserves the density parameter of the field.
Also the mass and couplings are suppressed by a small parameter.
These two things allow this model to also generate the dark matter density.
We have computed the asymmetry correctly in both models using the transport equation for different couplings. This has not been done in the literature as the original authors of the transport equation formalism only applied it to toy models of the axion with fixed field evolutions.
Furthermore we also elaborated on the possibility of implementing a model with multiple fields
but didn't managed to find a model with interesting dynamics which generates both the baryon asymmetry and the dark matter density, which was feasible to simulated and would fit into an axion framework.

\section{Future Developments}
The thesis project could be extended in multiple ways.
First one could continue to work on the multi field idea. Maybe it would also be interesting to implement inflation with an axion field.
Second one could consider more complicated couplings i.e. linear combinations of the couplings considered in this thesis.
Finally one could implement the baryogenesis mechanism during the electro-weak phase-transition as opposed to reheating like in the first example of ref. \cite{Domcke:2020kcp_Generic_Couplings}.
In any case the possibilities of spontaneous baryogenesis have not been extensively treated in the literature and leave multiple possibilities for future research.
